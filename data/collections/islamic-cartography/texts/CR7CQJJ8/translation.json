Several copies of this book are available. The author first learned of a copy in the Tabrīz Library, which is a relatively old copy. He requested a photograph of it from Dr. Yaḥyá Māhyār Nawābī, who at that time was the head of the Faculty of Literature at the University of Tabrīz. The burden of this effort fell upon Dr. Kāẓim, who at that time was engaged in teaching in the Geography Department of the Faculty of Literature of Tabrīz. He prepared a photograph of the copy and brought it to Tehran himself and handed it over to the author. Gratitude for this is obligatory upon this servant. From this copy, the original text was prepared and compared with copies from the National Library of Tehran, Paris, and Russia, which were old, and it was prepared for publication.\nthat\nWadi'i\nThe compared text was reviewed by the head of the Bonyād-e Farhang-e Īrān - Mr. Dr.\nKhanlarī.

    "8": "Twelve\n\nIn the Tabrīz copy, the name of this book is “Haft Kishwar”.\n\nThe Seven Countries\n\nIn the Paris copy, this book is called “Ṣuwar al-aqālīm” or “ʿAjāʾib al-Buldān”, and in its introduction in the film of the Central Library of the University, it is written: “The Ṣuwar al-aqālīm copy belongs to Paris, composed by the wise Plato.”\n\nIn the Leningrad Library catalogue, it is known as “Ṣuwar al-aqālīm sabʿah”, and on the first page of this copy, it is called “Haft Iqlīm”.\n\nIn the catalogue of handwritten books of the National Library, this book is introduced as “a book on geography” and is given number 626, but on the back of the first page of the book, in old handwriting, this book is called “Misāḥat-i Iskandar”, and on a paper that has been glued to the page, this book is called “Juġrāfīyā” and its author is considered to be “Aflāṭūn”. With the various names that the owners of the copies, scribes, and cataloguers have given to this book, we could not find its original name, so we chose the two names “Haft Kishwar” and “Ṣuwar al-aqālīm” for this book.\n\nOn this basis,\n\nValue of the Book\n\nThe present book is a book on geography in which the wonders of the world are also described. The division of the inhabited quarter, which they knew until that time, into seven climes, took place in two ways: either the climes were circular, meaning that the land of Iran was in a circle in the center and six other climes around it, so that each of these circles was tangent to the other and tangent to the central circle. Then they showed the seven climes in the length of the world. That is, they would come up a few degrees from the equator and draw a line across the world; this was the first clime. The other climes were also located in proportion to the equator along the length of the world, up to the seventh clime, which is the inhabited area below the North Pole.

    "9": "Introduction\nThirteen\nnorth reaches. The seven climes in this manuscript are such that the author begins with the east of the first clime and proceeds to describe it westward. Then he describes the second and third climes and the other climes. The Persian geographical book, Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam min al-Mashriq ilā al-Maghrib, which was written in the year 372, exactly 376 years before this book, has the same classification.\n\nThe difference between these two books is that Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam is a book whose author has not stepped outside the bounds of geographical topics. Whereas the author of the Haft Kishvar, when he comes to the major cities of each country, writes a description of the wonders and rarities,\nsome of which he has seen and most of which he has heard.\n\nMost of these wonders are outside the normal course of nature, and today they cannot be accepted and believed, such as a spring from which elixir is secreted, or masses of bird eggs that have become large white domes, or the manner of ostrich egg-laying, or amber wax from honey bees, or a baby rhinoceros emerging from its mother's womb and eating grass, or a whale which is an animal that has one hole in its body, and that is its mouth, or fish eggs becoming locusts on land and fish in water, or a woman conceiving from a tree, or a crowd of musicians who bring ants out of a box with the sound of drums and set them to fight, or a description of the excessive obesity of Egyptian women¹¹, or a worm that, when kicked, makes a jug of water big¹², or hearing the sound of the spheres that comes from the rubbing of the spheres against each other¹³, or continuous circular motion¹⁴, and the like.\n\n¹ ʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 13.\nʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 34\nʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 34\nʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 46\nʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 35\nʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 31\nʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 20.\nʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 20.\n10 - ʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 79\nʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 117\n¹¹- ʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 68\n¹³ ʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 25\n¹² - ʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 89\n¹⁴ - ʾAyn-i Kitāb, p. 53 955",

Such as the description he gives about silkworms¹⁵ and honey mines¹⁶, or the statement he makes about the connection between the evening twilight and the true dawn¹⁷, or the description he writes about the twenty-three-hour and twenty-four-hour days¹⁸, or the explanation he gives about the six months of night and six months of day at the pole¹⁹, or the guess he makes about the existence of the American continent²⁰, or the news he gives us about the author's eyeglasses²¹ which is apparently the oldest\ninformation about this.\n\nKraczkowski wrote the following description of this book in his book Arabic Geographical Literature²²:\n\nPersian geographical writings increased in the fourteenth century (eighth Hijri). For example, someone named Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā²³ wrote a book that was called Ṣuwar al-Aqālīm al-Sabʿa in several cases, but it did not always have this name²⁴.

The writer used the Arabic translation of it under the name Tārīkh al-Adab al-Jughrāfī al-ʿArabī.\n²³ Kraczkowski, quoting Kramers, considers the author of this book to be Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā, while the name of the author does not appear in any of the existing copies. Apparently, for the first time, the name of this author with his book under the name Ṣuwar al-Aqālīm appeared in Ḥāfiẓ Abrū's geographical book, and he writes that this author completed his book in India. Therefore, the author of the Haft Kishvar should not be the Ṣuwar al-Aqālīmī, which was written and completed in Kermān for Amīr Mubāriz al-Dīn Muḥammad.\nHuart, l' Afrique P.

    "11": "Introduction\nFifteen\nThe book was completed by its author in the city of Kermān²⁵ and presented to Amīr Mubāriz al-Dīn Muḥammad (713-759), who was one of the Muẓaffarid amirs. A copy of this global geographical book is among the manuscripts of the Soviet Union. The chapters of this book, according to the description of the Russian orientalist Zalman²⁷ and from the article of the French orientalist Huart, are as follows:\n\nThe first chapter is about the generalities of geography, and the second chapter is divided into seven sections according to the arrangement of the seven climes. Rieu's judgment about the contents of this book, which has pointed to its brevity and disruptiveness and considered it full of myths, superstitions and children's tales, is harsh and hasty.²⁸ This book is full of fresh material about northern Iran, and \"Dorn\" has come across this point, and it has a great deal of valuable information about Africa, the source of which is Arabic geographical books, the originals of which have not reached us.\"\n\nSome of the vocabulary of this book has an old recording and is worthy of investigation and study. Among them are:\n\n12/18 - ḫirʿitābī: Zebra.\n13/18 - manj: Honey bee.\n10/29 - hamshīrah: Two people who are breastfed at the same time.\n918/46- There is something like a turnip that the Arabs call kamʾah and the Persians kahar and the Khorasanians samārūgh.

    "12": "Sixteen\n\nThe Seven Climes\n\n18/51 - The word \"morgh\" (مرغ) in the past, besides meaning bird, was also used to mean butterfly. In 1360, that morgh is called \"zurzūr\" (زرزور) in Arabic, \"sār\" (سار) in Persian, and some call it \"Kāsīneh Kord\" (کاسینه کرد).\n\n18/67 - Three hundred and thirty *qaṣabeh* (قصبه) equals seven *qafīz* (قفيز). 12/69 *Pāyāb* (پایاب) means a hole that is made with a slope in the ground to access water or minerals.\n\nThis book is a small volume, and reading it is not without benefits. Its contents are not uniform, and there are many correct and incorrect points in it. However, it is an engaging book and indicative of the general understanding and beliefs of the time it was written.\n\nMap and Table of the Book\n\nThe *Haft Kishvar* (هفت کشور) book apparently came with a map that has not reached us. The author says in the introduction of the book: \"This humble servant, who has long been devoted to serving and supporting *Mobārez al-Donyā wa al-Dīn Mohammad* (مبارز الدنيا والدين محمد), and has been regarded by that gentleman with consideration and mercy, desired to draw a plan of the inhabited quarter for his library and to bring together in a composition a summary of what is known about the world.”²²\n\nAgain, in the first chapter of the same book, he writes: \"And we have divided the seven *aqālīm* (اقالیم) and what lies south of the equator in latitude and longitude into two-degree sections, and we have drawn a table and written the names of some famous cities that we knew, so that it may be known what relation each city has to another, and in what condition it is, and in which clime it falls. And there are many cities that we do not know, for it has become known that there are nearly four thousand cities in the areas and surroundings of Khitā and Khotan (ختا وختن), and only a few of their names have reached us.”²³\n\nIn this map, apparently, the names of cities that were in Arabic before the author's time and were called in Greek in his time have been recorded. He writes in\n\n²² Ibid., p. 4\n\n²³ Ibid., p. 7.",
    "13": "Introduction\n\nIndia\n\nthis regard: \"And the names of other cities have been established in Arabic and are now known in the language of the Greeks.\"²⁴\n\nIn addition to this map, this book also had a table in which the author had drawn the summer and winter paths of the sun and moon with different lines. The author writes about this: \"And we have drawn two lines for example, and from this line of the sun's descent, which passes towards the zenith, to that other line, which is the moon's descent, is about one hundred and twenty *farsangs* in width.\"²⁵\n\nIt is in this table that the difference in the hours of day and night, from the equator, where these two are equal, to the last point of the pole, which is six months of night and six months of day, has been shown by the author with different lines. It is likely that this table was combined with the map. It is a great pity that this map and table do not appear in the existing copies.\n\nAuthor of the Book\n\nWe do not have enough information about the author of this book, but it is clear that he spent some time in Kerman and has long been devoted to serving and supporting *Amir Mobārez al-Dīn Mohammad* (امیر مبارزالدین محمد) (713-759 AH).⁶² This sultan is from the *Āl-e Moẓaffar* (آل مظفر) dynasty, which conquered Kerman in 741 AH and Fars in 754 AH, and his son *Shāh Shojāʿ* (شاه شجاع) deposed him in Isfahan in 760 AH. The author wrote this book in his name in 748 AH. The author traveled to Hormuz and conducted studies on the coast of Hormuz. He mentions a mollusk from which China takes its ink, calling it a fish, and writes: “On the coast of Hormuz, it was observed that an animal had caught a creature that was like a wide shield and had a thin and long tail, like a rope tied to the edge of a shield, and had two wide eyes in the middle of its back, and its mouth was in the middle of its stomach and in the lower half.”²⁷\n\n²⁴ Ibid., p. 119\n\n²⁶ Ibid., p. 4.\n\n²⁵ Ibid., p. 21\n\n²⁷ Ibid., pp. 50, 519",
    "14": "Eighteen\n\nThe Seven Climes\n\nAnd about the sawfish, he writes: \"There is another creature in the sea that has something long growing from its head that has long teeth on both sides, and the *qalandars* (قلندران) hold it in their hands, and that creature sometimes attacks ships and strikes the ship and breaks it, and if someone is in the water and rises up, it strikes their waist and kills them.\"²⁸\n\nOn the same coast of Hormuz, the author saw and studied many creatures. In this regard, he writes, \"And on the coast of Hormuz, we saw a hundred thousand species, large and small, that had been shed.\"²⁹\n\nThe author sat on a ship from the coast of Hormuz and saw other creatures. About this trip, he writes, \"And we boarded a ship in Hormuz and saw a creature that was extremely white and had gathered in large numbers, and their heads were like wide hats, and their bodies grew from the middle, so that the surroundings were empty, and when they fell on the board, they died immediately.\"³⁰\n\nThe author also traveled to the province of Fars and other provinces. He writes: \"For we observed in the province of Fars and several other provinces that black clay is brought from the mine and placed in a crucible and melted, and the essence of iron is separated from it.\"³¹\n\nWe see the author once on the road between Hamadan and Baghdad. He writes about this: \"And on the road between Hamadan and Baghdad, on the south side, a spring of sulfur was witnessed that came out like a stream of milk and solidified.\"²\n\n²²\n\nApparently, the author traveled to Baghdad by the same route and spent some time there. About this trip, he writes, \"We have seen a lot in Baghdad and other cities that when a dump is filled, they pour lime into it and burn it, and what remains becomes stone and clay.\"³³\n\nThe author is a man of books and study and knowledgeable in astronomy. The explanation he gives about the stars *abadi al-khafī* (ابدی الخفی) and *abadi al-ẓohūr* (ابدی الظهور), and the calculation he made about the rising and setting of the star *Suhail* (سهیل) in Kerman and Fars, is sufficient evidence of his astronomical knowledge.\n\n²⁸, ²⁹, and ³⁰ Ibid., p. 51 ³¹- Ibid., p. 43\n\n³²- Ibid., p. 35\n\n³³ Ibid., p. 43.",

The scholars of Islam, in the time of the Caliph al-Maʾmūn, at his direction, in the desert of Sinjār—which is a plain with no mountains, rises, or depressions—faced the North Pole and measured the altitude of the star called al-Jadī with an instrument, and surveyed the earth, finding one celestial degree to be twenty-two farsangs and one-ninth of a farsang, which has a small difference from the measurement that the sage Archimedes made. Since each part of the earth corresponds to a part of the celestial sphere, and the celestial sphere is three hundred and sixty degrees, the earth must also be taken as three hundred and sixty degrees. When we multiplied by twenty-two farsangs and a fraction, it came to eight thousand farsangs, and this is the circumference of the terrestrial sphere. The diameter of the earth is two thousand five hundred and forty-five farsangs, and the total surface of the terrestrial sphere is twenty thousand thousand and three hundred and sixty square farsangs. The surface of the inhabited quarter from the equator to beneath the North Pole is five thousand thousand and ninety farsangs. The area of the Seven Climes with their seas, valleys, mountains, and deserts up to the complete obliquity, which is the limit of the world's habitation, is three thousand thousand seven hundred and fifty-six thousand four hundred and twenty farsangs. That which is outside the Seven Climes to the north, where there is no habitation, vegetation, or animal life, is one thousand thousand three hundred and thirty-three thousand five hundred and eighty farsangs. Since the length of the inhabited quarter is half of the terrestrial sphere, from the farthest east to the farthest west it is four thousand farsangs.\n.\n1 - In the original with \"degree,\" the word \"each\" was added from the Russian manuscript. 2 Original: wādī.

And from the other side of the equator where the southern pole is visible [and] the northern pole is setting, they have found land and settlements to the extent of sixteen degrees, and that is outside the seven climes. The southern latitude of those places amounts to three hundred and fifty-six farsangs, and its length from east to west amounts to approximately four thousand farsangs.\n.\nThe origin of the longitude of cities is taken from the beginning of the western settlements, which they call the Fortunate Islands (Jazīra Khālidāt), and in ancient times it was inhabited and now it is submerged. The sages of India take the beginning of longitude from the farthest east, a place they call Kangdiz. And the beginning of latitude is agreed upon from the equator, where day and night are always equal, and [around] ² the celestial sphere is biaxial, and in the oblique horizons, both northern and southern, the celestial sphere becomes like a shoulder-belt, and under the pole [it becomes millstone-like, and at the equator both poles are on the northern and southern horizon]. And we have divided the seven climes and whatever has southern latitude beyond the equator by two degrees of longitude and latitude, and we have drawn tables and written the names of some famous cities whose names we knew, so that it becomes known what relation each city has with another city and in what situation it is and in which clime it falls. And many of the cities are such that even we have not known them, for it has become known that approximately four thousand cities are in the regions and surroundings of Khitā and Khotan, and little of their names has reached us.

And also the celestial decree by the command of God Almighty is such that if in one region plague or massacre occurs, in another region there would be abundance and security, and never would any calamity be universal such that it reaches all the people of the world,\nexcept the Flood, which would be the Day of Resurrection.¹\nAnecdote\nThe sages say that since the celestial equator circle with the circle of the ecliptic—which are two great circles of the starless sphere and the sphere of fixed stars—diverge from each other by twenty-three and a half degrees, from this proportion that some of the earth has emerged from the surrounding ocean and become exposed, it must be that another quarter opposite this quarter, whose horizons' latitudes are southern, should be inhabited. For if two circles are drawn, each having a center and intersecting at two opposite points, certainly inclination occurs from both sides. And since the inhabited quarter exists due to the inclination of the ecliptic from the celestial equator, another quarter must be inhabited and there must be another world. When it is day for us, it is night for them, and vice versa; when it is spring for us, it is autumn for them, and vice versa; our west is their east and vice versa.

So if this is true, it indicates that another quarter of the terrestrial globe is opposite this inhabited quarter, and our west is their east, and their east is closer to our west than other directions, and the sea distance would be less—wa Allāh aʿlam.\nNow then, we said that every part of the parts of the earth corresponds to a part [of] the celestial sphere, and several thousand fixed stars that God Almighty created in the regions of the eighth sphere—\nand\neach star of these passes over the zenith of some people and place, and the rotation of the spheres and the motion of the wandering and fixed stars appear in a different configuration at each place on earth. Thus each place on earth has a particular property, and the form, appearance, custom, way, language, and terminology of every people and nation differ. Due to their difference in relation to the celestial equator, it is possible that at every place on earth a total change may occur, such as ruin and prosperity, and the customs and conduct of people, and so forth. And the cause of change, by the command of God Most High, may be that a star whose passage is not at the zenith may come to pass at the zenith, or a star that rises and sets may become perpetually invisible, or a star that is perpetually invisible may come to rise and set.\nFor example, Nasr Wāqiʿ (Vega), which at this time—the date being the year 748 from the Hijra of the Messenger—is rising and setting in the vicinity of Khurāsān and ʿIrāq.

And when it reaches the sign of Aquarius, in Khurāsān and Ādharbāyjān the same condition will occur. And when it comes to the signs of Pisces and Aries, in ʿIrāq and Fārs and Kirmān it will also rise and set, and until the sign of Cancer, which is at one hundred [degrees], it becomes perpetually visible this way down to the first clime. And when it reaches the beginning of Gemini until the end of the sign of Cancer, in Makka and Ḥijāz it was perpetually visible.\nAnother is the star Suhayl, which at this date in Kirmān and Fārs is rising and setting. When approximately three thousand years pass from the Hijra of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, it will become perpetually hidden and cease to rise and set. And when such a sign occurs for a fixed star, a comprehensive condition will appear among that people and in that place, and several matters will undergo change, and the saying of the Most High: «ويتفكرون في خلق السمواتِ والارض ربنا ما خلقت هذا باطلاً سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ»\nNow then, they have divided the inhabited quarter into seven sections, and each section they call a clime.

And if there is heat and cold in these four climes that we mentioned, it is relative to the climates of that place. And in the third, fifth, and fourth climes there are both hot lands and cold lands, and the form and appearance and capability and strength and manliness and valor and courage and management of livelihood and luxuries of the people were better and more than in these other three climes.

After that, in the western half in the third, fourth, and fifth climes, settlements and populations were proportionally greater than in other climes,\nand the people of the first clime due to heat and burning, and the people of the seventh clime due to cold and rawness, are of low ambition and beast-like nature and lacking in prudence, especially those born in the furthest eastern regions.\n\nAmong the special properties of the earth, one is that every emanation that descends from the rotation and movement of the celestial spheres and stars by the command of God Most High—\"يدبر الأمر من السماء الى الارض\" (He directs the affair from heaven to earth)—terminates at the earth, for the body of the earth is the center of the universe and the lowest of the four elements. Thus, according to the receptivity of each location, something different takes form, and since celestial configurations and positions are infinite, various compositions are also without limit. Indeed, the earth is the world of generation and corruption.\n\nAnd another property of the earth is that the four elements, which are simple, through the influence of the celestial spheres and stars by the command of God Most High, intermingle with each other on the surface of the earth. For if it were not so, no composition would take form and no temperaments would appear, and there is no pure earth, wind, water, or fire on the surface of the earth. [Rather,] whichever of the four elements one may conceive, particles of other elements are with it, for the absolutely simple does not have that form and nature. And if a form were required, it would be spherical, just as [if] a piece is thrown into the air, when it comes down it becomes round and spherical.

Furthermore, air that freezes and becomes harder and firmer than what is possible to freeze—if a little warmth did not remain in it, all would become ice of one hardness. And if the four elements did not mix with one another and did not break each other's temperament so that the fifth temperament would emerge, no composition would take\nform.\nAnd the belief of the ancient sages is that when God Most High created the celestial and terrestrial worlds, He entrusted the terrestrial beings to the celestial ones and left them to them, for God Most High is [transcendent and] the Cause of all causes. As He said: «وبنينا فوقكم سبعا شدادا وجعلنا سراجاً وهاجاً وآخر لنا من المعصرات ماء فجاجا لتخرج به حبا ونباتا وجنات الفافا».\nAs for what lies beyond, the truly pure simple element exists outside the surface of the earth at a complete distance, and every simple part of the elements, spheres, and stars that is farther from the surface of the earth is stronger in simplicity. Just as the sphere of fire, which is three degrees farther from the surface of the earth, has greater power of simplicity, for whatever reaches it is immediately burned. And it is also from this meaning that the fire on the surface of the earth, despite having a temperament mixed with other elements, whatever comes into contact with it quickly becomes hot or is burned, unlike water and air [for if] something is placed in water and air, over the course of time it becomes like them. And the water of the Encompassing Sea, which has descended from the surface of the earth, is purely simple, and no creature takes form in it.

For example, the philosophers have determined through experience that when the planetary stars are at perigee, their influence becomes weak, whereas since the ray of starlight is effective on earth, they should have become stronger because they have come closer to the earth by the measure of the diameter of the eccentric sphere and epicycle, which is the world of compounds.\n[But] as for the inhabited quarter, from where the equator is, where night and day are always equal, up to sixty-six and a half degrees, which is the full obliquity and the limit of habitation, from the northern side they have divided it into seven parts and call them the Seven Climes.

And the length of the first clime from east to west is more than the second clime, and the second clime more than the third clime, and so on until the seventh.

They seized him and at night placed him in the idol-temple and cast him before the great idol. That Muslim recited the Quran all night long. When day came, they opened the idol-temple and found him alive. They displayed the utmost amazement, for they had never witnessed such a thing. They honored and revered him greatly, [saying] that our god did not kill him. They gave him much gold and jewels, and he became so established among them that whatever authority he exercised, they tolerated. And they say that at this time several other Muslims have gone there and are rulers over the people of that island.\nThere is another island that is a gold mine, and after it there is another island to the east of this island, which is on the shore of the Encompassing Sea. There is an exceedingly high mountain, and there is a fortress atop that mountain, exceedingly white and luminous, which they call the Luminous Fortress. When one ascends to the top of that fortress, they hear the sound of the celestial sphere grinding together, and at the end of night and beginning of day it is heard more often.\nQuestion\nAt the end of the second clime, in the vicinity of Qannawj, the capital of India, there is a mountain that is seven farsangs in height. Due to its extreme height, at morning prayer the sun falls upon the peak of that mountain and at evening prayer it has not yet set. Similar to this mountain in height, in the south of Luristān on the road to Shūlistān, there is one they call Grīva-yi Mār. At night they lodge in the middle of the mountain and cross it in two days. How is it that on these high mountains they do not hear the sound of the celestial sphere?",
    "58": "26\nAnswer\nHaft Kishwar\nNot every mountain that is taller is closer to the celestial sphere, for on the surface of the earth there are many elevations and depressions, and furthermore [that] at all times dust and vapor rise from water and earth, and especially in any place where there are meadows, animals, and waters, vapor and dust become a veil for sounds. Never does [vapor] and dust not rise from mere water and earth, and when the sun comes above the earth upon the ground, vapor and dust ascend more. And since this Qalʿa-yi Muḍīʾa is on the shore of the Encompassing Sea and the water is pure and absolute, and there is no land or meadow in those regions, the path for sound is open and clear and one can hear.\nFor example, we have often seen and heard that if someone on the road falls behind the caravan at night for rest, and at dawn the roads on both sides become confused to him, he places his ear to the ground and [from one farsang away] hears the sound of the caravan's footsteps and knows which road he must take. And this meaning is because the dust and vapor that the sun raised during the previous day has mostly dissipated and scattered and settled, and the air has become clear—whereas during the day one cannot hear even a tenth of a farsang.\nNow then, the proof of how on top of that mountain which is seven farsangs in height the sun shines on the mountain fortress at morning and evening prayers: if at the foot of that mountain there is a strong sea, there are valleys and chasms, and around it are tall mountains and very dense trees, from mid-morning until afternoon they mostly do not see the sun, and it becomes dark from the mountain's shadow, for night is the shadow of the earth, and winter days grow dark sooner. And when the sun reaches the horizon\n1 These two words have been added from the Russian manuscript. 2 - Manuscript \"M\": if the foot of that mountain which is the Sea of Qirm, and in the Russian manuscript diyār qūmat, and the Paris manuscript: \"Sea of\nQirmat.\"",
    "59": "Chapter Two\n27\nwhen it approaches the east and west it becomes extremely dark and appears like night. Thus they perform the morning and evening prayers in darkness due to the disappearance of the sun, and since the mountain is seven farsangs in height, it is possible that from the foot of the mountain to the summit there are several ridges, so that when at the beginning and end of the day the disc of the sun shines upon the mountain peak, it does not cast rays into the foot of the mountain and the valleys and chasms, and the reflection of light is not perceptible. Therefore at the beginning and end of the day there is extreme darkness, and God knows best.\n\nAnecdote\n\nFīthāghūras the sage, to whom the science of ethics is attributed, and some also say he was a prophet and was king, commander, and ruler over his people, and was a leader and chief among the great ones of his time—on top of a high mountain where in that vicinity dust and mist rarely rose, he built a strong, elevated fortress from a compound reaching close to the frigid atmosphere, such that he could hear sounds from the celestial sphere. From those various sounds of the spheres that touch one another, he derived the instruments of musicians and singers, and determined each melody, instrument, and mode for which time it serves as treatment for the insane and epileptic. And when the people of the age spent their time in frivolity and jest and indulged excessively, the lawgiver declared it forbidden, and physicians abandoned those benefits with which they treated the sick. Also, every celestial emanation that is specific to a particular place is stronger, and when distributed to various places it becomes weaker.\n\nOne day, one of the students of Buqrāṭ the physician went to him to learn.

If I thought of something suitable for nourishment, it was not soothing and aperient, and if I thought of something that would thin the matter and open the obstruction, it did not provide nourishment. And at this moment when you entered, the answer came to my mind that all three\nmeanings are present in it, and from the utmost joy such happiness affected me that no restraint remained and I involuntarily jumped up. Just as there was a sage who wanted to draw a circle that would have a parallel circular surface with the center point exactly in the middle, equal from the center to the circumference on all sides, so that by the power of this circle he could obtain the knowledge of celestial cycles. However he drew it, it did not come out well. One day a design occurred to him: he tied one end of a stick together and sharpened the other end with a nail, placed it on a flat surface and rotated it—a parallel circular circle took shape with the center exactly in the middle, and every line he drew from any side of the circumference all passed through the center. When this observation occurred and he conceived from it the form of earth and heaven, such spirit and joy appeared in him that the animal spirit completely expanded from his heart to the extremities of his body and departed, and at that very moment he died at his work.\n1 Original: مجموع. 2 Russian and Paris manuscripts: نيك. 3 Russian manuscript: علم ادوار افلاك.",

And if that bowl was placed on the ground in a specific position in waterless deserts and wildernesses, it would condense the air and turn it into water that would collect in the bowl. Once such a drum and bowl were found in a treasury and brought before the king of the time, for they were made most delicately and pleasingly, but they did not know their use. The king struck the drum, and a wind separated from him with a sound. He was offended and embarrassed, so he tore the drum and broke the bowl. And when they later learned of their benefits, they felt regret, but it was of no use.\nMost sages were completely serious, such that they would never display in assemblies and gatherings certain qualities that they share with animals, such as exposing the body naked, spitting, expelling other bodily wastes, lying down, sleeping, eating food and drink, raising one's voice loudly, striking someone with something, and so on—all their discourse was of wisdom, teaching, and learning.\nNow, beyond the Luminous Fortress, there is another island to its north.

Thus the waste of the rhinoceros young in its mother's belly is absorbed little by little. And since she can bear such a large offspring, she can also bear a little waste, especially when most of it has been absorbed.\n\nFor example, we have often seen in Baghdad and other cities that when a rubbish heap becomes full, they pour lime on it and burn it, and what remains becomes stone and clay.\n\n¹ This description, with slight variation, is given under the name rukh in the Russian manuscript.",

When it fully ripens, it produces manna that is extremely sweet; for this reason they named patience ṣabr, because after bitterness it yields sweetness.\n\nThese islands are attributed to the Sea of ʿUmān, and when the Indian Sea produces waves, it casts out white tutia.\n\nAs for tutia, it is of four types: one is that which the waves of the Indian Sea cast onto the shore, which is extremely white; the second is found in rivers; the third is that in the desert there is a place called Fayd where much is found, and they say it rains from the sky; and the fourth is mineral from the province of Kirmān, and mineral tutia is abundant.\n\nAfter that, when one passes these islands and seas, there is the kingdom of Yemen, which has approximately two hundred farsangs in length and width, and Yemen is surrounded by sea on three sides, and the northern side is Ḥijāz and Makka; and Ṭāʾif and the city of Bilqīs, which they call Sabāʾ, is in Yemen; and there is much diamond and mines of carnelian and onyx; and there are two mountains in Yemen called Jabalā Ṭayy, and in the vicinity of those two mountains is the dwelling and residence of a people who were mostly noble and renowned, and Ḥātim Ṭāʾī was from that tribe, and the ʿĀdites and Musaylima the Liar were from Yemen.\n\n1 - Russian manuscript: Suquṭra.

He asked him, \"Where are you going?\" He said, \"I am going to Ḥātim, for I have three daughters and I need three thousand dinars to give them in marriage.\" Ḥātim became sad that this old man would go and not find him and return disappointed. He called the old man back and said, \"I am Ḥātim who has fled, and they have proclaimed that whoever brings Ḥātim shall receive whatever he desires. Now seize me and go to the foot of such-and-such mountain where some tents are pitched, and say that you have captured Ḥātim. Take three thousand dinars and hand me over to them.\" The old man said, \"I will not do this.\" Ḥātim insisted.

When the king heard these words,\nhe descended from his throne and placed his head at Ḥātim's feet and said, \"With someone like you who sacrifices his precious life for the sake of an old man whose desire was a trifling matter, it is not fitting that anyone else should sit in your place.\"\n1- Original and Paris manuscript: gharaḍī; corrected according to the Russian manuscript.\n.",
    "70": "38\nHaft Kishvar\nAfter that there is a city at the beginning of the kingdom of Yemen which they call «Najrān»\nand in the Jāhiliyya they had built a Ka'ba which was their pilgrimage site, and they called that Ka'ba Dhū al-Khalīṣa, and Khalīṣa is the name of a tribe, and the army of Islam destroyed it, and the destruction of Najrān is proverbial among the Arabs. But in Ṣanʿāʾ of Yemen there is an extremely sturdy palace which they call Qaṣr Ghumdān, and they say that the first building constructed after the flood of Noah was Qaṣr Ghumdān, and the kings of Yemen held that palace in high regard.\nAfter that, in the city of ʿĀd they erected a minaret of copper and made a human figure also of copper atop it, and during the four sacred months—which are Rajab, Dhū al-Qaʿda, Dhū al-Ḥijja, and Muḥarram—abundant water would flow down from it, such that they would drink from it and give it to livestock and collect it in pools and reservoirs, and when the month ended it would stop again, and this matter is famous among the Arabs and is a divine thing whose essence no one can fathom.\nNow then, at the end of the kingdom of Yemen is ʿAdan, and an inlet extends from the sea to the shore of a city which they call Qulzum, and they call that inlet Lisān al-Baḥr, and from where that sea extends the distance is no more than forty farsangs, and it goes to about two hundred farsangs, and when one passes ʿAdan and Lisān al-Baḥr and Jabal Maʿād, there is the kingdom of Ḥabasha and Barbara. The length of these two kingdoms is about five hundred and fifty farsangs and three hundred farsangs in width up to the border of the kingdom of Egypt, and the Nile River and several other rivers pass through those two regions, and all the people of these two regions are black and Muslim and God-fearing.\nAnd south of the cities of Ḥabasha and Barbara is the kingdom of Zanj, and there is a great city near the equator which lies between the Sea of Yemen and Marj al-Baḥrayn, and",

One named ʿAbd al-Muʾmin proclaimed in the land of Barbara that \"I am the Mahdī,\" and he was a learned and scholarly man. He composed a book that was neither the jurisprudence of the Sunnīs nor the jurisprudence of the Shīʿīs. However, it was better than Shīʿī jurisprudence and closer to Sunnī jurisprudence, and he summoned a people from that land and struck coins in his own name, and the ʿAbd al-Muʾminī gold has fame, and east of Ṭarābulīs, in the Maghrib, he founded a city and named it Mahdiyya, and we have written Mahdiyya in its proper place, and the call was accepted from the city of Mahdiyya to the farthest reaches of Barbara, a distance of nearly seven hundred farsangs, and they read his book and translate it into the Ḥabashī and Barbarī languages. There is a group among the Barbara among whom there is absolutely no immorality, corruption, debauchery, falsehood, dishonesty, or theft, and they do not speak any word by which they would become sinners, and they make no interference or meddling or questioning of God's dominion, and every year more than twelve thousand of them, men and women, come on pilgrimage with the Egyptian caravan, and most of them are on foot.\nOnce someone arrived in the land of Barbara and the life and ways of that people pleased him, so he said: \"I want a woman from you whom I may take in marriage and live among you.\" They said: \"Sit by the roadside for several days, for women who are without husbands pass by there. When one catches your eye, tell us so we may give her to you.\" After several days when he had taken the woman to his home, the man came home from the fields at midday and said: \"Oh! How hot it is!\" And his wife says: \"What business do you have with God's dominion and decree\"",
    "72": "Haft Kishwar\nhe sent [a message asking] whether it is hot or cold. He summoned the people and obtained a divorce from her, and that person departed from that land.\nAfter that, when one passes beyond the borders of دنقله and حبشه and the believing districts and بربره, there is another territory with various peoples, and some of them are of wild nature,\nwithout clothing or garments, all black, and there are many mountains, and good waters,\nand abundant [rivers] come from there and join the sea of مرج البحرین, and some join the western sea, and another great river comes from جبل لاهو and the equator and flows into the western\nsea.\nAnd in the first clime on this side there is a great city, and some of them\nare Muslims and there is a gold mine, and that city is called غانه.\nAfter that is the coast of the western sea, and an island from whose shore much ambergris is found, and there are several other large islands. And to the south of this place there is a city called نوبه, a famous city in the western region, and south of نوبه are the districts of لم لم, and these people are all black and beast-like in nature, wild and malicious, and man-eaters, and neither men nor women wear any clothing, and the people of نوبه and that region do not go alone to the border of لم لم, and from نوبه to the border of لمالمه is about eighty farsangs.\nAfter that is the coast of the Ocean, which is the beginning of the longitude of the inhabited quarter, and this is taken from there after the جزایر خالدات which in ancient times was inhabited and was the beginning of the settlement of the West, about two hundred and twenty farsangs of water has covered [it].",
    "73": "Chapter Two\nOn the Description of the Second Clime\nThe beginning of the inhabited lands in the far east of the second clime consists of the cities of Chīn and Māchīn. The length of that kingdom extends to five hundred and fifty farsangs and its width amounts to nearly three hundred farsangs. Qarāqurm, which is the capital of the Khāqān, lies on the border of Chīn, which is the beginning of the third clime. Its climate is temperate and various bounties and textiles are available there. Tin and silver are abundant, but gold is produced less than silver. The people of the province of Chīn are fair-featured and slightly dark-skinned. Most of them are idol worshippers and Muslims are few. They say that in Chīn there is an idol temple, and around that temple they have placed lodestone on all sides, and they have made an idol of iron and suspended it in the middle, standing upright, because when the attractive force of the lodestone is equal from all directions, it remains suspended. They say that in the idol temple of Sūmnāt as well, they had made an idol in the same manner, until the army of Islam destroyed it.\n\nIn the first and second climes, people were idol worshippers, star worshippers, and irreligious. Mānī the painter was from Fārs and came to the kingdom of Khitā, and from there came to Chīn and took up residence.",

Several other mountains extend to the city of Zaytun, and Qannawj, the capital of India, is approximately five hundred and fifty farsangs in length. In that vicinity there is a mountain that is seven farsangs high, and there is a desert around which there are high mountains, and one cannot go there, and in that desert there are many diamonds. People go to the top of the mountain and place pieces of meat on catapults and throw them into that desert, and when they fall to the ground, diamonds stick to them. Vultures and other carrion-eating birds pick them up and carry them to the mountaintop, and when they eat, the diamonds fall off and are collected. The climate of this region is warmer than China.\nAnecdote\nOnce a merchant from Khurasan saw someone in those regions cultivating and asked: What are you planting? He said: Iron. The merchant was amazed. The Hindu said: This is more wondrous than what they say that in your land stones fall from the sky and some turn to ice. Both were astonished at each other's words and marveled, and",
    "75": "Chapter Two\n23\nEach of them would say: \"This exists and we see it, but what you say is impossible.\"\nHowever, a rational proof regarding iron can be stated, for we have observed in the province of Fārs and several other provinces that they bring black clay from mines, place it in crucibles, melt it, and the essence of iron separates from it. If desert clay contains the essence of iron and water is added to it, and iron particles are scattered and placed in the clay, when the hot sun shines upon it and heat is generated and spreads, those iron particles attract the essence of iron to themselves according to the affinity of iron's nature—just as a snake-stone draws poison to itself from the pores and interior of the human body by affinity with venom—and those scattered particles grow larger. If iron particles are rubbed with powdered and dissolved lodestone, perhaps the attractive force would increase.\nIn this province there are many sorcerers, more women than men, and there are people who burn the dead. They teach this practice based on a philosophical doctrine, as the sages of India say that when the body is completely annihilated, the soul has no attachment remaining and becomes united [with the divine], but as long as the body exists, the soul remains attached to it.\nFurthermore, in this city there are two or three olive trees that are under government administration, and they produce something with a tight skin. When broken by hand, something with the taste of wheat flour comes out, from which they make various foods and bring and sell it by the kharwār.\nAfterwards, when one crosses the mountain waters, on the southern side, which is the beginning of the second clime, are the cities of India, and on the northern side, which was the end of the second clime, are the lands of India, Dībal, and parts of Makrān and Banpūl.\nIn the regions of Sind and Makrān there is a tree that produces something hollow",
    "76": "Haft Kishvar\nAnd a small and thin worm is inside it, and it remains alive inside for one year. A group whom they call Kāwlīyān, who travel around the regions and practice medicine, collect these. When someone has a toothache, they say \"this is a worm in his tooth.\" They perform an operation in such a way that no one is aware, and they show that worm to him saying \"we extracted this from your tooth,\" and thus they deceive people.\n\nAfter that, when one passes the waters of Sind, there is the Persian Gulf, and Mughān and Jīruft and Hurmūz and the warm regions of Kirmān and Fārs up to Khunj and Sīrāf and the coast of the Sea of Baṣra. On the coasts of this sea there are many ports, and no port is like the port of Hurmūz and Jarūn, which is the center of the world and the frontier of Kirmān and Fārs, and close to Iraq and Khurāsān and Ādharbāyjān and most of the inhabited settlements of the inhabited quarter.\n\nAfter that, when one passes the Gulf of Baṣra, there is Qaṭīf and Baḥrayn and Laḥsā and Hajar and Yamāma and the Arabian desert and Makka and Madīna and the land of Ḥijāz up to the coast of the Sea of Qulzum, which they call Lisān al-Baḥr. The Arabian desert up to the foothills of Mount Ṭāʾif is called the Arabian Peninsula because it lies between two seas.\n\nWhen the year of the Alexandrian calendar reached nine hundred, the sages said that the superior conjunction was shifting from the airy triplicity to the watery triplicity, and the first conjunction would occur in the sign of Scorpio, which is the house of the term and the house of the face and the triplicity of Mars, and pertains to the Arabian Peninsula. This indicates that a prophet would arise from the Arabian Peninsula whose proof would be the sword, and he would conquer the entire world, and that is the Master of the End Times.\n\nIn this sea of Qaṭīf and Baḥrayn there are varieties of pearls, and they are finer than those of other seas, because according to astrological reasoning, pearls belong to the sign of Cancer in the second clime, and Qaṭīf and Baḥrayn pass through the samt al-raʾs, and every sign and planet that passes through the samt",

Most likely it is the seed of a plant that has the taste of wheat. There was much gum, taranjabīn, and gazangabīn. In that desert there were many ostriches, and they call the ostrich egg \"bayḍat al-balad,\" because it lays its egg on the open desert, and the Arabs call the desert \"balad.\" Whoever is the noblest and most excellent of a people, they say he is \"bayḍat al-balad.\" When ʿAmr ibn ʿAbd Wudd was killed at the hand of Amīr al-Muʾminīn ʿAlī—peace and blessings upon him—his sister said two verses about his rank: if the killer of ʿAmr were not ʿAlī, I would weep at all times, and it is no shame that his killer is bayḍat al-balad. Those two verses are:\n\nلو كان قاتل عمرو غير قاتل\nلكن قاتله من لايعاب بـه\n\nVerse\n\nبكيته ما اقام روح في جسدي.\nوكان يدعى قائماً بيضة البلد\n\nMeaning he is the noblest of the people. Also, someone who is lowly and worthless is also called bayḍat al-balad, and this meaning is derived from the ostrich egg, because its eggs are many.\n\nAnd it knows that at first when the chick is small, it cannot go to the desert to graze",
    "78": "26\n\nHaft Kishvar\ncannot go. It divides the egg into three parts: one part it hides in the earth, one part it places in the sun until it dries, and another part it places under its feathers. When it hatches chicks, first it breaks what has dried in the sun and gives it to the chicks, and afterward it brings out what it had hidden in the earth and gives it. After a few days have passed, [the chick] can go to the desert to graze. Therefore, people call both the honored and the lowly bayḍat al-balad.\n\nThere is another thing in the desert resembling a turnip with no branches or leaves; the Arabs call it kamāh, the Persians call it kahr, and the Khorasanians call it samārūgh. They fry and eat it, and eating it is very harmful to the brain. It appears on the surface of the desert, and they also call it bayḍat al-balad, and in the desert it was boundless.\n\nHowever, approximately one hundred and fifty farsangs distant is the Sea of Qulzum, and on the shore of the Sea of Qulzum is the city of ʿAdhāb and Sudan. There are two significant mines, one of gold and one of emerald, and it is the end of the realm of Egypt and the beginning of the realm of Abyssinia. Beyond that is the Nile River, and beyond that the desert and mountains inhabited by nomads, and flowing waters. Most of those people are black, and the southern part of this region borders Barbar and Abyssinia. Beyond that are other waters and wide and deep streams extending to the city of Manūs, which is the farthest west, and two or three other inhabited islands. In these mountains and deserts there are many beneficial medicines and several plants that serve as antidotes and treatments for leprosy and vitiligo. Rare things are brought from this place, including a stone that when dropped into vinegar, jumps out, and they take it as a gift to kings. There is another stone that when water is dripped onto it, a fire ignites, and when olive oil is poured on it, the fire is extinguished.\n\n1. This word was added from the Russian manuscript. 2.

It attracts silver to itself and has other properties besides this.\n\nAnd there are streams of running water, and on its bank is sugarcane, and in ancient times there was no sugarcane in other climes and lands, and they did not know what sugarcane was, and they ordered the syrup of the sick from grape molasses, and in the time of Iskandar, sugarcane appeared in the world.\n\nTale\n\nIn Abyssinia, they had built a Kaʿba and held it dear and respected, and it was their pilgrimage, and this house was called Qalīs. A person from the tribes of Quraysh was jealous and took medicine and went into that house at night and fell into diarrhea and made everything impure, and he fled in the same night. The next day they knew that that person had come from Mecca. They made an agreement, and the Aṣḥāb al-Fīl came with an army, as is well known, to destroy the Kaʿba in return for the impurity.

All seven planets made a conjunction together. Astronomers said that a storm of wind would arise that would destroy all the buildings of the inhabited quarter. When such a rumor of conjunction spread in the world, people became frightened and built places in the basements and went to streams and wells and took valuables and necessities. When the conjunction occurred,\n\nthere was no wind and the air did not move at all, they were surprised, because the sign of Libra has the image of a human being, it should have been judged that a strong wind would come. Although Libra is an airy sign, so that many people would be destroyed, although it has the image of a human being. _Khwāja Naṣīr al-Dīn Ṭūsī_ says that I wanted to say what sign would appear in the world from the effect of this, I went back in reverse, it was a sign of Chingiz Khan, who had more than ten thousand people killed by him and his followers.

At the beginning of the famine, all animals, halal and haram, were eaten, and after that people ate relatives and children, and after that they turned against each other and killed and ate anyone they could find. And an epidemic also appeared with the famine, so that several thousand people died every day, and after that they resorted to eating carrion, and it reached a point where they would bring the dead out of the grave and eat them, and wherever a bone fell, they would pick it up and eat it, and many of those people went on their way around and did not reach their destination and died on the way. Little was what we said in total compared to what was destroyed in the province of Egypt, no one was there, and all the abandoned properties of those people had no intruder or occupant, and in all places they lay dead and stinking, and a person who had come from a distant place to observe reported that wherever I went, I heard no sound and saw no one, just as *wa-liman al-mulk al-yawm lillāh al-wāḥid al-qahhār* and all that desert became a haunt of wild beasts, and that famine reached the kingdom of Syria and Alexandria, and many people died, and the famine and epidemic became such that they died by seeing and breathing in and hearing each other's breath and breath, and it is said in history that some thought they were healthy, and in one industry and craft, which took two hours, several people stood in place of each other and died one after another, and this epidemic and famine reached all the provinces and cities of Egypt and Syria, and the city of Quds was the worst compared to the bad cities.\n\nAnd if all the people of the world that Chingiz Khan and his followers killed were to be, there would be no place for people in the world at this time.

It is said in history that such an earthquake occurred in Syria and its surroundings that the sea water split and a ship came to the bottom of the sea to the ground and then returned and brought the ship up and moved a place from one place to another and two mountains that were in the middle of it joined together.\n\nA person narrated that in the year 773 AH, a severe earthquake occurred in Kerman and its surroundings, and it was more severe in Khabis, and many positions, gardens and trees fell to another location, and in Dhu al-Qa'dah of the year 741 AH, another earthquake occurred in Kerman, and it was narrated that two mountains came close to each other.\n\nQuestion\nHow was it that in the state of an earthquake, a place would go to another place and a mountain would approach another mountain?\n\nAnswer\nThe earth has many cavities and is porous and the pores are open, and because the vapor that causes the earthquake is born and wants to come out, it pierces a place from the earth [and splits it, and that place that was open, of course, from one side, the parts of the earth do not bind together and become strong, and that amount of earth\n\n1- This part was added from the Russian version.",

That is because the parts of the water have gone into vapor and the parts of the wood have taken its place and sat together.\n\nAnother example is that if a hard stone is thrown to the ground, of course a pit will appear and the amount of the stone's volume will be emptied of clay. However, that clay has not gone anywhere, but the parts of the clay have sat together and accepted compression.\n\nBut after that, in the area of Egypt there is a city called Kisum and a place called Hisn Mansur.

So, a city from which Jews cannot come out except on Saturday—several thousand people and several animals are in that city, and they have essential provisions and necessities—from where do they obtain it, and how do they live?

Once, the Qāḍī of Ṭūs was going to Farghāna. A great man said a couplet for the sake of the Qāḍī and the last hemistich of it is: ʿA cow is this one that goes from this house to that house. And in Mā Warāʾ al-Nahr, they have said that a scribe's son and a harpist's daughter are needed. There are many scholars and learned men, and Abū ʿAlī Sīnā was from Mā Warāʾ al-Nahr.\n\nThere is a city that they call Nakhshab, and a fuller was from the village of Nakhshab, who was named Muqannaʿ, and he knew and performed many illusions, talismans, and tricks.

Ultimately, matters became difficult for him, and he knew that they would capture and kill him. He frightened them by saying that he would go to heaven, return, and give them an answer. Maqannaʿ's intention was that since they would not see him, fear and apprehension would remain in the people's hearts. He lit a furnace full of fire and heated it intensely, and he killed the slave and the maid he had and buried them under the ground. A little maid escaped from him and hid. Maqannaʿ threw himself into the furnace and burned. After a day or two passed, they did not see Maqannaʿ, and they had no news of him. They investigated and searched for him. The little maid came and said that he had burned himself. When they sought his bones from among the ashes and found them, they knew that he had burned himself.\n\nBut there is another city called Ṣaghāniyān, and there was a scholar in that city who knew the Arabic language well and was known as Ṣaghānī. He wrote a book on language and began with «Alif» and wrote seven hundred names for *asad*. When he reached the letter «Bāʾ,» several volumes had been produced, and he died with the word «bukm». And it became a proverb that Ṣaghānī died with the word *bukm*.\n\nAfter that is the kingdom of Khurasan, and it is said that the kingdom of Khurasan is the breast of the prophets and the highest place in the inhabited quarter; Khurasan is *qubbat al-arḍ* and *sutrat al-arḍ* [that is farther from the surrounding seas on all sides, and Khurasan and *qubbat al-arḍ*] were the center of the inhabited world, and most of the cities of Khurasan are very populous and have abundant blessings, and in ancient times it was the seat of kings, and many scholars, sages, sheikhs, elders, and sultans have been from Khurasan.

He said to him, \"Have you done much prayer and obedience that you have such a pure face?\" He replied, \"What is prayer and obedience? *Tawallā* and *tabarrā* are necessary, meaning *tawallā* to Amīr al-Muʾminīn, peace be upon him, and *tabarrā* from others.\"\n\nAfter that, the end of the kingdom of Khurasan is Dāmghān and Jurjān, whose northern side was Jīlān and Māzandarān, and on its southern side was ʿIrāq-i ʿAjam.

Some say that he descended from the roof of Luhrāsp.\nLuhrāsp said, “Who are you?” He said, “I am a prophet, and I come from God to invite you to God.” Luhrāsp asked him for a miracle. One was that he had a peerless horse, and all four of its hands and feet were sunken into its body and had fallen. He said, “I want this horse to be healed by your miracle.” Zoroaster gestured four times, and the horse became well and stood up. Then Luhrāsp accepted his religion and made it famous, and Gurshāsf and Isfandiyār and Bahman all strengthened and promoted the religion of Zoroaster, and Iran and some of the Turks, Indians, and Arabs adopted his religion. They presented the Zend and Pāzend. He made five things obligatory for them: agriculture, generosity, honesty, non-violence, and reverence for the king, and he prescribed prayer for them three times a day and made the sun their qibla, and at sunrise, sunset, and noon, he taught them some words to recite in prayer, and the words are: Ashm wahu wa hishtam astī ushnā astī ushnā ahmāʾī hītāshāʾī wa hishtāʾī ashm ـ bitā ahū vīrbawā tā ratūsh āshāt chīt hachā wa nigih ush duzdāmunihū shīwatini nāma anghih ush mazdāʾī khushtarīhā ahurāʾī āʾīm dar gū biyuddat wa istārm.

But they are lying, for Zoroaster is not Ibrāhīm Khalīl, and other Magians say that God and Iblīs are two brothers. For a thousand years, the world revolves around God, and for a thousand years, it revolves around Iblīs. Surely, Zoroaster did not say this, for it is far from wisdom. And also, Zoroaster said that paradise and hell and resurrection and recompense and punishment exist, and Ahriman and Surūsh exist, and Surūsh comes to me from God, and you must not be deceived by Ahriman and strive for goodness. Therefore, Zoroaster did not say this.\nAnd at the beginning of the Abbasid caliphate, the Āl ʿAbbās saw a person in Khorasan who had gone on top of a tall dome that had no way in from any side.

Several copies of this book are available. The author first learned of a copy in the Tabrīz Library, which is a relatively old copy. He requested a photograph of it from Dr. Yaḥyá Māhyār Nawābī, who at that time was the head of the Faculty of Literature at the University of Tabrīz. The burden of this effort fell upon Dr. Kāẓim, who at that time was engaged in teaching in the Geography Department of the Faculty of Literature of Tabrīz. He prepared a photograph of the copy and brought it to Tehran himself and handed it over to the author. Gratitude for this is obligatory upon this servant. From this copy, the original text was prepared and compared with copies from the National Library of Tehran, Paris, and Russia, which were old, and it was prepared for publication.",

The author wrote this book in his name in 748 AH. The author traveled to Hormuz and conducted studies on the coast of Hormuz. He mentions a mollusk from which China takes its ink, calling it a fish, and writes: “On the coast of Hormuz, it was observed that an animal had caught a creature that was like a wide shield and had a thin and long tail, like a rope tied to the edge of a shield, and had two wide eyes in the middle of its back, and its mouth was in the middle of its stomach and in the lower half.”²⁷",

The scholars of Islam, in the time of the Caliph al-Maʾmūn, at his direction, in the desert of Sinjār—which is a plain with no mountains, rises, or depressions—faced the North Pole and measured the altitude of the star called al-Jadī with an instrument, and surveyed the earth, finding one celestial degree to be twenty-two farsangs and one-ninth of a farsang, which has a small difference from the measurement that the sage Archimedes made. Since each part of the earth corresponds to a part of the celestial sphere, and the celestial sphere is three hundred and sixty degrees, the earth must also be taken as three hundred and sixty degrees. When we multiplied by twenty-two farsangs and a fraction, it came to eight thousand farsangs, and this is the circumference of the terrestrial sphere. The diameter of the earth is two thousand five hundred and forty-five farsangs, and the total surface of the terrestrial sphere is twenty thousand thousand and three hundred and sixty square farsangs. The surface of the inhabited quarter from the equator to beneath the North Pole is five thousand thousand and ninety farsangs. The area of the Seven Climes with their seas, valleys, mountains, and deserts up to the complete obliquity, which is the limit of the world's habitation, is three thousand thousand seven hundred and fifty-six thousand four hundred and twenty farsangs. That which is outside the Seven Climes to the north, where there is no habitation, vegetation, or animal life, is one thousand thousand three hundred and thirty-three thousand five hundred and eighty farsangs.

And the beginning of latitude is agreed upon from the equator, where day and night are always equal, and [around] ² the celestial sphere is biaxial, and in the oblique horizons, both northern and southern, the celestial sphere becomes like a shoulder-belt, and under the pole [it becomes millstone-like, and at the equator both poles are on the northern and southern horizon]. And we have divided the seven climes and whatever has southern latitude beyond the equator by two degrees of longitude and latitude, and we have drawn tables and written the names of some famous cities whose names we knew, so that it becomes known what relation each city has with another city and in what situation it is and in which clime it falls. And many of the cities are such that even we have not known them, for it has become known that approximately four thousand cities are in the regions and surroundings of Khitā and Khotan, and little of their names has reached us. And also each city has several towns, villages, and farmlands, and dependencies and annexes, the knowledge of which is not possible for anyone, except the dependencies of a city or places of a kingdom that can be known, which in relation to the inhabited quarter",

Beyond that, from the island of ʿUmal, there are Khaṭāṭa and Warāṭa and Safālīya extending to a city called Tūhīya, and the length of that region is approximately five hundred farsangs and its width is two hundred and fifty farsangs. In these districts there are mountains and flowing waters and meadows and flourishing deserts and abundant beneficial trees and plants, and great rivers flow and join the sea of the inhabited quarter. The mountains and stones of this region contain much gems and gold, but the people of that region do not know smelting and silver refining. They go and gather much firewood at the foot of the mountain and set fire to it until the stone softens and the gems and gold melt and fall amid the fire, then they collect them from among the ashes. These people are all black and fond of amusement and merriment, and the reason for this is that the elevation of the star called Suhayl reaches forty degrees [there] and rises as high as the star Shiʿrā does in Iraq and Khorasan, and the effect of the rays of Suhayl is cheerfulness, and whoever gazes upon it frequently, grief and sorrow find less way to him. The people of the island of ʿUmal and the lands of Safālīya and Zanj and the regions that we shall mention, extending to the farthest west and the vicinity of the equator, are mostly fond of merriment, amusement, and joy.

And in this distance the earth has become burnt like ash, and the River Nīl passes through it, and when the water increases, it brings much black mud with it, and the water is black — for this reason they call it Nīl. However, this meaning has no truth, that because of the sun's rays and heat the earth becomes black, for in the first and second climes, especially in the western half, the heat and warmth of the sun is greater than on that side of the equator, and no earth",

Once such a drum and bowl were found in a treasury and brought before the king of the time, for they were made most delicately and pleasingly, but they did not know their use. The king struck the drum, and a wind separated from him with a sound. He was offended and embarrassed, so he tore the drum and broke the bowl.

At the end of the first clime they arrived and built a dwelling, and each took a wife. When their children were still infants, the fathers passed away, and by this time their offspring have multiplied greatly. They know nothing of what Islam is, nor what Muṣṭafā, peace and blessings be upon him, and Murtaḍā, peace be upon him, have commanded. Surely this account has no truth and is a common legend.¹ Now then, to the west of these islands of the Far East, in the first clime as we mentioned, there is desert and many high mountains and streams of water that have neither width nor depth, and from the northern parts to the second clime extends the distance of these mountains and rivers. These streams come from the second clime, cross the equator, and join the sea. From the Islands of Idols to the bank of the Khamdān River, the breadth of these mountains and streams extends for a distance of three hundred farsangs, and there are humans and various animals and birds and trees and plants and flowers and aromatic herbs. Sandalwood and camphor and indigo plant and aloeswood and brazilwood are abundant, as well as peacocks and rukh and rhinoceros. Among the wonders is that there is the salamander, which is a bird that with feathers dwells in the midst of fire, and its refuge is fire, and its feathers do not burn; rather, fire emerges from it and falls upon the firewood. Also, it breeds in the midst of fire. Some people hold that it does not breed and that it lives for a thousand years, and when its time of death comes, it gathers much firewood and sets fire to that wood and burns itself in it. After that, rain falls upon its ashes, and by the command of the Creator another salamander appears from those ashes—surely this has no truth.",

After a few days, he asked about the dervish. They said that he had died and had ordered that such-and-such sealed bag should be given to such-and-such _khwāja_. When they gave me that bag, I opened it in the house, I found a piece of wax that had an image on it. Immediately I saw a terrible blackness that had appeared. He said, \"What is the service?\" I was afraid and that wax fell from my hand, in that moment he picked it up and disappeared. After that I knew what the benefit was. I regretted very much that that dervish had subdued the spiritual beings.",

When such a rumor of conjunction spread in the world, people became frightened and built places in the basements and went to streams and wells and took valuables and necessities. When the conjunction occurred, there was no wind and the air did not move at all, they were surprised, because the sign of Libra has the image of a human being, it should have been judged that a strong wind would come. Although Libra is an airy sign, so that many people would be destroyed, although it has the image of a human being. _Khwāja Naṣīr al-Dīn Ṭūsī_ says that I wanted to say what sign would appear in the world from the effect of this, I went back in reverse, it was a sign of Chingiz Khan, who had more than ten thousand people killed by him and his followers.

The Christians say that it is proof for us that the religion of ʿĪsā is the truth, and a group of ignorant common people who do not know that this is a trick and is also made by the Christians are deceived, and we will tell a clear proof of what that situation is, and what the Christians say, that Khidī sends a fire from the sky and the lamps are lit, is a lie. Because the situation is that the twenty-fifth of the month of Nisan was the birthday of Barkhiyān Muʿammar, and he was one of the disciples of ʿĪsā, peace be upon him, and he selected a separate Gospel from the Gospel of ʿĪsā, and on that day the Christians celebrate a holiday, and the twenty-fifth of the month of Nisan is the month of Urdībihisht in the Jalāli calendar, and the sun was at fifteen degrees of Taurus, and as God Almighty says:",

Whatever is around that crystal will catch fire, and people observe this meaning very often. That clever¹ people hold a white-surfaced bowl in front of the sun and rub some tallow in the middle of the bowl, and it catches fire, even though it is not as hard as crystal. And if a piece of stone is made in this way in the west, and the degree of the sun on that day is made right to that degree, so that when the sun sets, the center of the crystal and the sun are right, and a thin string or a piece of silk that is not visible is greased with naphtha oil so that if a wind comes, it will not put it out, because other oils do not have that strength, and one end of it is connected to the crystal and the other end to the lamps, so that it includes everything. And when the fire appears on the surface of the crystal, the thin string will immediately catch fire and all the lamps will be lit, and no one's hand will be in between, and they will say that the fire has come down from the sky, and the crystal stone must be installed on a height so that if someone happens to see the fire, they will see it coming from above to the ground and away from the lamps. So that if sometimes there is a cloud at sunset and the sun does not shine in the window, they can secretly set fire to that",
