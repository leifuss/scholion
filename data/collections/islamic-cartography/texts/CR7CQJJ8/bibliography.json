    "abstract": "This critical edition of Ṣūrat al-Aqālīm (Description of the Regions), edited by Manūchihr Sutūda and published by Bonyād-i Farhang-i Īrān in 1351/1972, presents an important but largely anonymous medieval Islamic geographical text composed in the 9th century CE (3rd century AH). The work comprises approximately 173 pages and forms part of the foundation's series on Iranian historical and geographical sources. The edition includes scholarly apparatus, textual notes, and bibliographic references to establish a reliable version of this foundational text in Islamic geographical literature, which synthesizes Ptolemaic and Islamic traditions of cartographic knowledge.",
