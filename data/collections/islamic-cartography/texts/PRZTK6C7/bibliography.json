    "abstract": "This article examines how Islamic astronomy of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries functioned as cosmology by analyzing Arabic translations of Greek texts and debates among Islamic astronomers about cosmic order. Morrison distinguishes between cosmography (describing external characteristics of celestial bodies) and cosmology (discussing underlying order in the universe), arguing that while most of ʿilm al-hayʾa was cosmographic, certain authors—particularly Muʾayyad al-Dīn al-ʿUrḍī and Quṭb al-Dīn al-Shīrāzī—engaged cosmological questions. The article traces how the semantic range of Greek kósmos (order, universe) was preserved in Arabic translations as ʿālam and niẓām, and shows how the technical term nafs al-amr (the fact of the matter) became central to discussing cosmic order in later astronomical works.",
