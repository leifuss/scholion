distinguished between cosmology and 'ilm al-hay'a and then blurred that dis-
tinction. Recently, Damien Janos has taken a more synthetic approach and
has argued, in the case of Färābi, that astronomy was a discipline from which
one could construct Fărăbi's cosmology, and that no single discipline that
Fārābi pursued mapped precisely onto the category of cosmology.7 George
Saliba has written that "[t]he best way to translate 'ilm al-hay'a into English is
to think of the term 'cosmography' in the literal sense. This is because hay'a, in
this context, simply meant the attempt to describe the apparent behavior of
the cosmos [...] celestial spheres interpreted and understood in the same sense
as in Aristotelian works upon the subject."8 Ragep, in his 1982 dissertation, had
also described part of Ţusi's enterprise in the Tadhkira as cosmography.⁹ Cos-
mography is an appealing translation of 'ilm al-hay'a because it reflects how all
writers on 'ilm al-hay'a were certainly describing the apparent behavior of the
cosmos. But since cosmography could also be understood as 'writing the cos-
mos' and, thus, as a way to study the cosmos, 'ilm al-hay'a might also be cosmo-
logical in ways in addition to the cosmographic. This article will investigate
instances when authors on 'ilm al-hay'a went beyond cosmography, or beyond
the definition of cosmology that one might call cosmography - explaining
what the cosmos looked like - and ventured into a different subset of cosmol-
ogy, a subset that communicated a certain understanding of cosmic order, and
exploring the cosmos as an ordered universe, versus others.
As all authors on hay'a presumed that the motions were uniform, I am look-
ing for arguments or contentions that there is an underlying order in the cos-
mos (cosmology), not simply arguments that a given set of observations can be
explained in terms of uniform motions (cosmography). The genre of hay'a gen-
erally excluded 'why' questions, preferring to confine itself to descriptions of
the external aspects of the celestial bodies.10 Metaphysical statements about

The distinction between 'ilm al-hay'a and cosmology blurs in F. Jamil Ragep, "Astronomy,"
in Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas and Everett Rowson, eds.,
Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE (Leiden, 2009), <http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_
COM_22652> last accessed 19.05.2019. Ragep wrote that 'ilm al-hay'a al-basita specified "a
certain genre of theoretical astronomy/cosmology." Three of the four sub-headings of the
article included the word 'cosmology. For another example of the blurred distinction
between ilm al-hay'a and cosmology, see Morrison, "Islamic Astronomy."
