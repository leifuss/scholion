COSMOLOGY AND COSMIC ORDER IN ISLAMIC ASTRONOMY

order in the cosmos were borrowed, not discussed. Thus, most of hay'a turns
out to be cosmography, but there are cases in which authors talk about the
universe's underlying order, and this article aims to clarify which is which and
why. Within the history of 'ilm al-hay'a, the article focuses on writers associat-
ed with the Maragha Observatory through 1400. Academic discussions of Is-
lamic cosmology in all periods have been complicated by the wide semantic
range of the Greek ho kósmos (cosmos), by how the Arabic words 'alam (world)
and nizam (order) render more than one Greek term respectively, and by how
neither Arabic lexicographic dictionaries nor texts translated from the Greek
make a necessary connection between 'äalam and nizam. Acknowledging the
range of possible uses and definitions of Arabic words like 'alam and English
words like 'cosmos' is important background for the debates about cosmic or-
der that follow. Thus, the article begins by examining the semantic range of
kósmos in Greek and how that and related words were translated into Arabic.
These lexicographic considerations matter because they clarify why thirteenth
and fourteenth-century discussions of the cosmos may or may not communi-
cate an inherent order.
These different stances on whether the cosmos was inherently ordered are
the focus of the first part of the article. Second, the paper will examine the
ways in which some writers on 'ilm al-haya, particularly Mu'ayyad al-Din al-
'Urḍi (d. 1266), discussed 'ilm al-hay'a's models in terms of the cosmos' under-
lying order. As earlier scholarship has suggested, 'Urdi's position could have
developed out of a conversation or debate with kalām." Third, following 'Urdi,
the article engages the astronomy of Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (d. 1311), which fea-
tured increased confidence about the correctness of astronomy's models but
fewer references to an ordered cosmos. Fourth, the paper, as an interlude, will
mention Şadr al-Shari'a's (d. 1347) position about how the knowledge afforded
by 'ilm al-hay'a was restricted to particulars and did not lead to knowledge of
an essential natural order. Şadr al-Shari'a's response to Shirazi and Nasir al-Din
al-Ṭūsi's theoretical astronomy illustrates how one could be an influential writ-
er on 'ilm al-hay'a without arguing that there was an underlying natural order
detectable through the systematic interrogation of creation. Fifth and finally,
the article will cover ways that discussions of an ordered universe, in works on
'ilm al-hay'a written at the beginning of the thirteenth century, endured even
without as strong a dependence on the physics and metaphysics derived from
