Ibn Sinā. Specifically, the technical term nafs al-amr (the fact of the matter)
became relevant to discussions of cosmic order.

Introduction: The Greek Semantic Background and the Semantic
Range of the Arabic Translations
The wide variety of the ways in which the word kósmos, which informs West-
ern understandings of cosmology, was used in ancient Greek and the different
semantic ranges of the Arabic translations of the relevant Greek terms compli-
cate the task of specifying how 'ilm al-hay'a was (or was not) cosmological. The
semantic range of the word 'alam, often used as a translation for kósmos, does
not include all of the ways in which kósmos was used in ancient Greek, but
adds some others, as is acknowledged in the Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second
Edition article "Alam." Likewise, there are Arabic texts that address seemingly
cosmological matters, such as the Arabic treatise Fi Mabadi' al-kull, which
Charles Genequand translated as On the Cosmos, even though the world kós-
mos was probably not in the title of Alexander of Aphrodisias' Greek original
upon which the Arabic text was based.12 Still, Fi Mabadi' al-kull was dedicated
to a holistic view of the cosmos, the question of cosmic order, as well as that
order's moral implications. Likewise, Aristotle's De Caelo had much to say
about the cosmos, but was also concerned with more than cosmography, i.e.,
with more than just the physical models that accounted for and predicted ob-
servable celestial motions.13 Reviewing the semantic range of the relevant
Greek terms and how they passed into Arabic lends insights into why a writer
in English might classify all of these topics as cosmology, and why different
writers in Islamic societies wrote about the cosmos in different ways.
The semantic range of the Greek kósmos affected the semantic range of the
analytic term 'cosmology' in European languages. To survey the ways in which
kósmos was used in classical Greek literature, I consulted Liddell, Scott and
12 See Charles Genequand, Alexander of Aphrodisias on the Cosmos (Leiden-Boston, MA,
2001).

One translator of Aristotle's De Caelo (On the Heavens) was Yahya Ibn al-Bitriq [within the
Kindi circle; see Dimitri Gutas, Greek Thought, Arabic Culture (London-New York, 1998),
145.] Both Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd produced versions of the De Caelo, but De Caelo's
approach to astronomy, focusing more on physical principles and less on mathematical
precision, became less prominent in Islamic societies with the rise of 'ilm al-haya. On Ibn
Rushd's epitome and commentaries on the De Caelo, see Gerhard Endress, "Averroes' De
Caelo: Ibn Rushd's Cosmology in His Commentaries on Aristotle's On the Heavens," Arabic
