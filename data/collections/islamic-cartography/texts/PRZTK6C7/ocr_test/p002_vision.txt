COSMOLOGY AND COSMIC ORDER IN ISLAMIC ASTRONOMY
341
Encyclopedia of Religion that "Cosmology refers to more consciously enter-
tained images, doctrines, and scientific views concerning the universe."² Some
scholars have acknowledged this range of meanings in their work. For instance,
in the Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Tjitze de Boer clarified in the first
part of the article on 'alam (world), which implicated definitions of the cos-
mos, that he was not addressing "the scientific development of the cosmogon-
ic teaching of Aristotle and Ptolemy in Islām" and referred readers elsewhere.3
He focused, instead, on philosophical, qur'anic and theological (i.e., in the
sense of 'ilm al-kalām) speculation about cosmogony. In the second part of the
article, Louis Gardet described sufi and illuminationist (ishraqi) cosmologies,
again setting aside cosmologies that drew on fields such as natural philosophy
and science.
Other scholarship has focused on the cosmologies found in science and phi-
losophy texts. Y. Tzvi Langermann, in his 1997 survey article "Arabic Cosmolo-
gy," defined cosmology as "that enterprise which describes what the universe
looks like."4 Langermann clarified that the focus of his survey was the tradition
of 'ilm al-hay'a, a locus for numerous, fascinating discussions in Islamic societ-
ies about astronomy. Scholars besides Langermann have used 'cosmology' as a
translation for the general field of 'ilm al-haya.5 Other scholarship has both

Langermann wrote, "The 'cosmologists' of whom we shall be speaking shared the common
concern of providing an adequate portrayal of the physics of the universe as a whole, but
especially of the celestial regions."
