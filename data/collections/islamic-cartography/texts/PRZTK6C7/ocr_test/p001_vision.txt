Cosmology and Cosmic Order in Islamic Astronomy

Abstract
This article analyzes how the astronomy of Islamic societies in the thirteenth and four-
teenth centuries can be understood as cosmological. By studying the Arabic transla-
tions of the relevant Greek terms and then the definitions of the medieval Arabic
dictionaries, the article finds that Arabic terms did not communicate order in the way
implied by the Greek ho kósmos (ó xóσuoc; the cosmos). Yet, astronomers of the period
sometimes discussed cosmic order in addition to describing the cosmos. This article
finds, too, that a new technical term, nafs al-amr (the fact of the matter) became part of
later discussions of cosmic order.

Defining Islamic cosmology, the cosmology of Islamic societies, is not simple
because cosmology does not have historic equivalents in languages such as
Arabic, Persian, or Ottoman Turkish, and does not map onto a single actors'
category. Cosmology has been applied to synthesize a wide variety of sub-fields
within Islamic studies, ranging, on the one hand, from the synthesis of a num-
ber of scientific approaches to the universe, and on the other hand, to the de-
scription of the world views of sufis to the outlooks implicit in certain social
structures.¹ Survey articles capture this range in various ways. We read in the
