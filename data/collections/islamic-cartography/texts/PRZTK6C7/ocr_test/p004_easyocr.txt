order in the cosmos were borrowed, not discussed. Thus; most of haya turns out to be cosmography; but there are cases in which authors talk about the universe's underlying order; and this article aims to clarify which is which and why: Within the history of 'ilm al-haya, the article focuses on writers associat- ed with the Maragha Observatory through 1400. Academic discussions of Is- lamic cosmology in all periods have been complicated by the wide semantic range of the Greek ho kosmos cosmos), by how the Arabic words alam (world) and nizam (order) render more than one Greek term respectively; and by how neither Arabic lexicographic dictionaries nor texts translated from the Greek make necessary connection between 'alam and nizam. Acknowledging the range of possible uses and definitions of Arabic words like 'alam and English words like 'cosmos' is important background for the debates about cosmic r- der that follow: Thus, the article begins by examining the semantic range of kosmos in Greek and how that and related words were translated into Arabic: These lexicographic considerations matter because they clarify why thirteenth and fourteenth-century discussions of the cosmos may or may not communi- cate an inherent order These different stances on whether the cosmos was inherently ordered are the focus of the first part of the article_ Second, the paper will examine the ways in which some writers on 'ilm al-haya, particularly Mu'ayyad al-Din al- 'Urdi (d. 1266 ) , discussed 'ilm al-hay'ds models in terms of the cosmos' under- lying order: As earlier scholarship has suggested, 'Urdis position could have developed out of conversation Or debate with kalam_ Third, following 'Urdi, the article engages the astronomy of Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (d. 1311), which fea- tured increased confidence about the correctness of astronomy' models but fewer references to an ordered cosmos Fourth, the paper; as an interlude, will mention Sadr al-Shanas (d. 1347) position about how the knowledge afforded by 'ilm al-haya was restricted to particulars and did not lead to knowledge of an essential natural order Sadral-Sharras response to Shirazi and Nasir al-Din al-Tusi's theoretical astronomy illustrates how one could be an influential writ- er on %ilm al-haya without arguing that there was an underlying natural order detectable through the systematic interrogation of creation: Fifth and finally, the article will cover ways that discussions of an ordered universe, in works on ilm al-haya written at the beginning of the thirteenth century; endured even without as strong dependence on the physics and metaphysics derived from
