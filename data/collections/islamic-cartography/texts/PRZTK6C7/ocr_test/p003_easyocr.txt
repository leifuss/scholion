distinguished between cosmology and 'ilm al-haya and then blurred that dis- tinction_ Recently; Damien Janos has taken more synthetic approach and has argued, in the case of Farabi, that astronomy was discipline from which one could construct Farabi s cosmology and that no single discipline that Farabi pursued mapped precisely onto the category of cosmology' George Saliba has written that "[tJhe best way to translate %ilm al-haya into English is to think of the term 'cosmography' in the literal sense: This is because haya,in this context, simply meant the attempt to describe the apparent behavior of the cosmos [-] celestial spheres interpreted and understood in the same sense as in Aristotelian works upon the subject Ragep; in his 1982 dissertation, had also described part of Tusis enterprise in the Tadhkira as cosmography ? Cos- mography is an appealing translation of ilm al-haya because it reflects how all writers on 'ilm al-haya were certainly describing the apparent behavior of the cosmos: But since cosmography could also be understood as 'writing the cos - mos' and,thus; as way to studythe cosmos; 'ilm al-haya might also be cosmo logical in ways in addition to the cosmographic: This article will investigate instances when authors on 'ilm al-haya went beyond cosmography; or beyond the definition of cosmology that one might call cosmography explaining what the cosmos looked like and ventured into different subset of cosmol- ogy; subset that communicated certain understanding of cosmic order and exploring the cosmos as an ordered universe versus others: As all authors on haya presumed that the motions were uniform, am look- ing for arguments or contentions that there is an underlying order in the cos- mos cosmology), not simply arguments that a given set of observations can be explained in terms of uniform motions cosmography) The genre of hay a gen- erally excluded 'why' questions, preferring to confine itself to descriptions of the external aspects of the celestial bodies_ Metaphysical statements about
