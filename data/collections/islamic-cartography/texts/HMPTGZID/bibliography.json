    "abstract": "This article examines how early Islamic theologians (mutakallimūn) engaged with competing cosmographical models—traditionalist Qur'anic and Aristotelian-Ptolemaic—from the second/eighth through sixth/twelfth centuries. Drawing on kalām texts, Qur'anic commentaries, and hadith compilations, the author demonstrates that disagreements among mutakallimūn on cosmographical questions paralleled late ancient Christian debates, and that some Mu'tazilis rejected the plain-sense reading of Qur'anic cosmography in favor of Aristotelian doctrine. The article challenges the historiographical neglect of cosmography in Islamic intellectual history and argues that traditionalist cosmography, rather than scientific ignorance, represented a deliberate theological position against which rationalist theologians defined themselves.",
