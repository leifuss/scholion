  "9": "1. Introduction\r\nA. Varäham ihira and his w orks\r\nVaräham ihira, the son of Ädityadäsa, was a Maga E rähm ana—that is, a des￾eendent of one of those Persian Zoroastrians who entered India toward the beginning \r\nof the Christian era1. We learn from the penultimate verse of his Brhajjätaka (XXVIII, \r\n9) that he was a native of Avanti or Western Mälwä (see also Pancasiddhäntikä \r\nXVII,61) and resided in a village called Käpattika. His date is delimited by his use \r\nof Lätadeva’s epoch, A.D. 505, in the Pancasiddhäntikä (see below p.8) and by \r\nthe fact that Brahmagupta was fam iliar with his work when he wrote the Brähma￾sphutasiddhänta in A.D. 6282. It has further been suggested that he was connected \r\nwith the Aulikara court at Dasapura (m odern M andasor), and in particular with \r\nYasodharman who is known to have been ruling in Samvat 589 = A.D. 532s, though \r\nno definite assertion can be made with regard to this hypothesis.\r\nVaräham ihira was a prolific author in the three traditional skandhas of jyotih￾sästra4. On ganita he composed only the Pancasiddhäntikä; on horä he wrote the \r\nBrhajjätaka and the Laghujätaka; and on samhitä the Brhatsamhitä and the Samäsa￾samhitä. He also composed three works on military astrology—the Brhadyäträ, the \r\nTikanikäyäträ, and the Yogayäträ — as well as a Vivähapatala on the astrology of \r\nmarriages. Several other works have been attributed to him, but their authenticity \r\nis doubtful.\r\nOf the relative chronology of the works of Varäham ihira some notion may be \r\nderived from his cross-references. In Brhajjätaka XXVIII,4-6 he seems to indicate \r\nthat his karana, the Pancasiddhäntikä, as well as treatises on interrogations5, on\r\n1 See, e.g., D. K. Biswas, “The Maga Ancestry of Varähamihira,” Indian Historical Quarterly 25,\r\n1949, 175-183. Traces of Persian influence on the Pancasiddhäntikä are to be noticed in I, 23-25 and XV, 19.\r\nOn the Maga Brähmanas in general see now H. von Stieteneron, Indische Sonnenpriester. Samba und die\r\nSäkadvipiya-Brähmana, Schriftenreihe d. Südasiens-Instituts d. Universität Heidelberg 3, Wiesbaden 1966.\r\n2 The date A.D. 505 is certainly not used in the Pancasiddhäntikä because it is the date of his birth\r\nas is sometimes alleged. And there is no compelling reason to accept the tradition that he was one of the\r\nNine Jewels at the court of Vikramäditya, no matter whom that shadowy figure is identified with.\r\n3 See D. Pingree, \"The Empires of Rudradäman and Yasodharman; Evidence from Two Astrological\r\nGeographies,” JAOS 79, 1959, 267-270.\r\n4 A complete bibliography will appear in the appropriate volume of D. Pingree, A Census of the Exact\r\nSciences in Sanskrit, to be published in the Memoires of the American Philosophical Society.\r\n5 We have no work on interrogations by Varähamihira himself, but that of his son PrthuyaSas, the\r\nSatpancäSikä, does survive.",
  "10": "8 Nr. 1\r\nmilitary astrology, on omens (sam hita), and on the time of marriage (the Vivahapa￾tala) had already been written. Moreover, Pancasiddhantika 1,22 seems to refer to \r\nthe fact that he had not yet composed his books on hora, which include the Brhajja￾taka. The Brhajjataka, then, was written after the Pancasiddhantika.\r\nBut Pancasiddhantika XV, 10 refers to Brhatsamhita V,8—11, while the Brhat￾sarnita in several places (1,10; II (p. 22); V,18 (cf. Pancasiddhantika VII—IX); XV 11,1; \r\nand XXIV,5 (cf. Pancasiddhantika XIV,34)) refers to the Pancasiddhantika. Varaha￾m ihira must have been working simultaneously on both texts. Furthermore, Brhat￾samhita II (p. 68) lists the subjects to be covered by a work on horoscopy, but this \r\nlist is not a table of contents to either the Brhajjataka or the Laghujataka. Later (p. 71) \r\nthere is a list of subjects for a work on military astrology, but again the list does not \r\ncorrespond to any of his three books on this subject; and, moreover, Varahamihira \r\nonly rem arks that the subject has been written on by acaryas when he would certainly \r\nhave mentioned his own work if any such yet existed. It appears, then, that the Pan￾casiddhantika and Brhatsamhita were composed simultaneously towards the begin￾ning of his writing career, the Brhajjataka towards its end, and at least one work on \r\nmilitary astrology and the Vivahapatala in between.\r\nAgainst this theory it may be objected that Brhasamhita 1,10 states that Varaha￾m ihira had previously written extensively ( “vistaratas” ) on genethlialogy, military \r\nastrology, and marriage. Either one must conclude from this that he wrote all ol his \r\nmajor works simultaneously, or assume that 1,10 was added to the Brhatsamhita by \r\nVaraham ihira after he had finished the Brhajjataka. I he latter seems to us the more \r\nprobable solution.\r\nB. The epochs of the Pancasiddhantika\r\nVaraham ihira in 1,8-10 indicates that the ahargana of the Bornaka is counted \r\nfrom sunset at Yavanapura, which begins a Tuesday, at the beginning of the sukla￾paksa of Caitra in Saka 428. We identify this date with 6 P.M. at Alexandria on Mon￾day, 21 March 505 A.D., when the sunset day Tuesday began. The sunset at Yavana￾pura is reiterated in XV, 18, where it is attributed to Latacarya, the “commentator” \r\nof V araham ihira’s Romaka; and the Tuesday is confirmed by the rules for deter￾mining the week-days in I.17-216. In V III,1-5 we are given the Rom aka’s k$epas \r\nfor sunset at Avanti on 21 March 505, from which it is clear that a mean conjunction \r\nof the Sun and Moon will indeed occur (by the Rom aka’s calculations) shortly before \r\nsunset in Yavanapura.\r\nIn the ardharatrika system, which is used by Latadeva’s (?) Suryasiddhanta, \r\na sidereal year ends at 0;3,9 days after midnight at Avanti of 20/21 March o05. It is \r\nfor this time, or rather for the midnight exactly, that the ksepas of the planets are\r\n8 The long discussions by Dikshit and others about whether this date is really CaitraSuklapratipad\r\nare irrelevant as their computations are based on the elements of the ardharatrica system, not on those of\r\nthe Romaka.",
  "11": "Nr. 1 9\r\ngiven in XVI, 1-6. However, it appears that there was an earlier Süryasiddhánta which \r\nemployed a noon-epoch; the ksepas of the Sun, Moon, lunar apogee, and lunar node \r\nare given according to it for noon at Avanti of Sunday, 20 March 505. These devi￾ations from the epoch of 1,8 are due to the facts that the param eters of the various \r\nsiddhantas do not yield identical times for conjunctions and that days are assumed \r\nto begin at various epochs.\r\nBut Varaham ihira not only does not use a single epoch throughout his work; \r\nhe also fails to inform his reader accurately of the dates and sometimes even of the \r\nexistence of the epochs he employs that are different from that given in 1,8-10. His \r\nkarana thus becomes totally useless in many sections. If the reader remains ignorant \r\nof the epoch actually employed, he cannot obtain a correct result by following the \r\nrules in the text; and if he knows enough to be able to discover what the epoch was, \r\nhe no longer will benefit (except as an historian) from the Pañcasiddhántiká.\r\nG. V araham ihira’s sources\r\nIn 1,3 Varaham ihira states that there are five siddhantas: the Paulisa, the Romaka, \r\nthe Våsistha, the Surya, and the Paitamaha, and that of these the first two were com￾mented on by Låtadeva. It is precisely these five siddhantas which he urges an astro￾loger to study in Brhatsam hitå II (p. 22). But his sources, as he himself indicates, \r\nare more num erous; for he names Arhat (i.e., Jaina tradition) in XIII,8; Aryabhata \r\nin XV,20; Pradyum na in XVII,62; the Magas in 1,23; the teacher of the Yavanas in \r\nXV,19; Latadeva or Latåcårya in 1,3 itself and in XV,18; himself in XVII,61,62, and \r\n64; his Brhatsamhita in XV,10; Vijayanandin in XVII,62; and Simhacarya in XV, 19. \r\nWe are not justified, then, in regarding all the material in the Pancasiddhantika as \r\nhaving been derived from one of the five siddhantas named in 1,3. We can only \r\ndistinguish certain sections as being from one source or another on the basis of Vara￾ham ihira’s explicit statements, and then attempt to gather associated material around \r\nthese nuclei on the basis of their use of identical parameters. The colophons cannot \r\nbe blindly followed, as is demonstrated by that for chapter III; this attributes the \r\nwhole chapter to the Paulisasiddhånta, though 111,34-35 are certainly from the Ro￾maka and III,4 and 9 belong with II (Vasi$tha).\r\nAside from the Pancasiddhantika, one of our chief sources for a knowledge of \r\nV araham ihira’s sources is the Brahm asphutasiddhanta which Brahmagupta wrote \r\nin Bhillamåla in 628. He is mainly concerned there, when he mentions his predeces￾sors, either with praising his m ain source, the Brahm asiddhanta (i.e., the Paitåma￾hasiddhånta of the V isnudharm ottarapurana)7, or with attacking Aryabhata8; but he \r\nalso discusses certain aspects of some of the other works. A translation of all the \r\nrelevant passages will be found in the Appendix (cf. F, p. 22).\r\n7 Cf., e.g„ 1,2; 11,31; 11,33; V,25; X,62; etc.\r\n8 Cf., e.g., 1,12; 1,32; 1,61-62; 11,19; 11,33; 11,46-47; VI,12; IX ,11; X ,13-14; X I,4-45; etc.",
  "12": "10 Nr. 1\r\nI. The Paitamahasiddhdnta\r\nThis work is summarized in chapter XII of the Pancasiddhantika. Its epoch \r\nis 11 January 80 A.D. and its elements are derived from the Jyotisavedanga of Lagadha. \r\nVaraham ihira does not refer to the Paitam ahasiddhanta of the Visnudharmottara￾purana, though that work is apparently mentioned by Aryabhata (Golapada 50) and \r\ncertainly used by Brahmagupta as the basis of his Brahm asphutasiddhanta.\r\nII. The Vasisthasiddhanta\r\nThere existed a Vasisthasiddhanta already in A.D. 269/70 as Sphujidhvaja \r\nwrites in his Yavanajataka (LXXIX,3):\r\n“ By following the opinion of the sage Vasistha some of those concerned with \r\n(astronomical) rules (believe that this great lunisolar yuga) is best; for those led by \r\nthe Yavanas . . . (the lunisolar yuga) is 165 years.”\r\nVaraham ihira states in 11,13 that the shadow-problem in 11,12-13 is from the \r\nVasisthasam asasiddhanta (presum ably an abridgement of a longer original Vasistha￾siddhanta). We are inclined to believe that the rest of II is also from the Vasistha. \r\nIf this assumption is true, we have Vasistha’s solar theory (11,1), lunar theory (11,2-6; \r\nsee also III,4 and 9), theory of naksatras and tithis (11,7), rules for computing the \r\nlength of daylight (11,8), and gnomon-problems (11,9-13). The whole is based on \r\nBabylonian techniques fdtered through Greek intermediaries. The epoch of the lunar \r\ntheory is 3 December 499; this is perhaps the date at which the original Vasisthasid￾dhanta was turned into the Vasisthasam asasiddhanta available to Varaham ihira. \r\nA ksepa (presum ably added by Varaham ihira) accounts for the difference between \r\nthis epoch and 22 March 505.\r\nAll manuscripts insert after XVII,5 a note attributing the theory of Venus in \r\nXVI1,1-5 to the Vasisthasiddhanta; but these verses are an integral part of the whole \r\nsection XVII, 1-60 which presents a treatment of the motions of the five star-planets \r\nbased on Babylonian methods. This also may well be properly assigned to the Va￾sistha- (or Vasistasamasa-) siddhanta. The ksepas indicate as epoch 22 March 505; \r\nthey must have been added by Varaham ihira. An earlier Indian adaptation of Baby￾lonian planetary theory is found in Sphujidhvaja (LXXIX,40-47).\r\nBy 628 Brahmagupta knows only of a Vasisthasiddhanta published by Visnu￾candra (see Brahm asphutasiddhanta 1,62; 11,46-47; X,13 and 62; XI,31,46-51, and \r\n55; XVI,36; XXI,37-39 and XXII,2), who apparently combined ardharatrika (Lata) \r\nand audayika (Aryabhatiya) elements with some from Vijayanandin. He is con￾stantly linked in the Brahm asphutasiddhanta with Aryabhata and Srisena. It might \r\nhave been argued that his was the version of the Vasisthasiddhanta which is sum ­\r\nmarized in the Pancasiddhantika and which uses as epoch 3 December 499 (the epoch \r\nof the Aryabhatiya is also 499). But Visnucandra’s use of a mahayuga and of epi￾cycles, which are unknown to V araham ihira’s Vasisthasiddhanta, precludes this \r\nidentification. Visnucandra, then, must be dated in the latter half of the sixth century.",
  "13": "Nr. 1 11\r\nCopies of Viçnueandra’s Vasisthasiddhânta were still available in the ninth \r\ncentury as Prthüdakasvâm in, in his commentary on the Brâhm asphutasiddhânta, \r\nquotes from it three âryâs. The first (on XXI,3; the first two pâdas are also quoted \r\non X X I,lla -b ) is similar to Paulisa frag. P 51 :\r\nThus in the Vasiçthasiddhânta9.\r\n“The earth, consisting of the five m ahàbhütas (i.e., earth, fire, water, wind, and \r\nspace) stands in the middle of the space of the cosmic egg (jagadanda) for the exi￾stence of all creatures; it is round (and) called a sphere.”\r\nThis verse is also quoted by Utpala on Brhatsam hitâ II (p. 58).\r\nThe next fragment is quoted on XXI,4:\r\nThus in the Vâsiçtha siddhânta10.\r\n“ The sphere of the stars, which is covered with planets, nakçatras, and con￾stellations, constantly revolves from left to right in the sky.”\r\nAnd the third âryà is quoted on XI,54:\r\nThe yuga of precession (ayana) (is given) by Visnucandra at the beginning of \r\nhis chapter on yugas (yugaprakarana)11 :\r\n“The yuga of the ayana is said to be 189411 (revolutions); this was formerly \r\nthe opinion of Brahma, the Sun (i.e., Sürya), and so on.”\r\nAnother àryâ which is quoted as Vasistha’s by Utpala on Brhatsamhitâ II (p. 27) \r\nprobably comes from Vi§nucandra’s work:\r\nSo the revolutions of the Moon (in a mahâyuga), when multiplied by 27, (be￾come the days of) the nàkçatra measure in the opinion of Vasistha and others12:\r\n“ The nâksatra (days) in a caturyuga are said by the ancientsto be 1 559340072.” \r\nTwo other àryàs of astrological content are quoted as Visnucandra’s by Utpala. \r\nThe first is found in his commentary on Brhatsam hitâ XIX,8 and in that on Brhaj￾jàtaka II,2013:\r\n“ The conjunction with the Sun of (the five star-planets) beginning with Mars \r\ntogether with the Moon is called their (heliacal) setting, that (of the five star-planets) \r\nwith each other a (planetary) conflict.”\r\nThe second occurs in his commentary on Yogayàtrâ IV.48-5314:\r\n9 jagadandakhamadhyastha mahabhutamayi ksitih /\r\nbhavaya sarvasattvanam vrtta gola iti sthita //\r\n10 tatragre grahanaksatrataraganasamavrtah /\r\najasram bhramati vyomni jyotirgolah pradaksinam //\r\n11 tasya catra cid rudrakrtanandastakendavah /\r\nayanasya yugam proktam brahmarkadimatam pura //\r\nIf the precession makes 189 411 revolutions in a Kalpa, the yearly motion is approximately 0;0,57 °\r\nand the precession amounts to 1° in about 63 years.\r\n12 paksasaptakhaSunyabdhigunagorthaSarendavah /\r\ncaturyugarksany etani kathitani puratanaih //\r\nThe Vasistha’s revolutions of the Moon in a mahayuga, then, are those of the ardharatrika system:\r\n57 753 336.

  "14": "12 Nr. 1\r\n“ If there is a (weak) malefic planet in a cardine with a strong benefic, there \r\nis success for one who sets out (on a military campaign), though with difficulty; \r\nbut if it is a (weak) benefic with a strong malefic, there is no success.”\r\nIII. The Romakasiddhanta\r\nThe Romaka (one of the two siddhåntas which Varaham ihira claims to have \r\nbeen commented on by Lata) is evidently, because of its name, of western origin. \r\nSections of the Pancasiddhåntikå which can unquestionably be ascribed to the Roma￾kasiddhanta in Låta’s edition are 1,8-10; 1,15; 111,34-35; and VIII. These passages \r\ndiscuss the computation of the ahargana from the epoch—sunset at Yavanapura \r\n(= Alexandria) on 21 March 505; the elements of the Rom aka’s yuga; some specu￾lation on a “world-year” ; and solar eclipses. The use of sunset epoch, the Metonic \r\ncycle, the Hipparchan tropical year, and epicycles for the Sun and Moon indicate \r\nthat the original Rom akasiddhanta had an Hellenistic origin. One suspects that it \r\narrived in India during the period of Saka or Gupta rule in Western India. This \r\nRomaka is referred to by Brahmagupta in Brahm asphutasiddhanta 1,13.\r\nBut another Rom akasiddhanta was known to Brahmagupta. This was composed \r\nby Srisena on the basis of elements from Lata, Vasistha, Vijayanandin, and Arya￾bhata (see Brahm asphutasiddhanta 1,62; 11,46-47; X,13; XI,31,46-47,48-51, and 55; \r\nXVI,36 and 46; XXI,37-39; and XXII,2). Srisena was evidently contemporary with \r\nVi§nucandra.\r\nIV. The Paulisasiddhanta\r\nTo this work we can definitely assign 1,11-13, in which Varaham ihira gives the \r\nrules for determining the ahargana in the Paulisasiddhanta as commented on by \r\nLåtadeva. The same param eter for the length of a year appears in 111,1, so that at \r\nleast in part the colophon of III is correct in ascribing that chapter to Paulisa (it has \r\nbeen noted above that 111,34-35 refer to the Romaka; Latadeva, of course, may have \r\ninserted such a reference into his commentary). In this chapter again we find a mix￾ture of Babylonian and Greek methods, though with a strong influence of Indian \r\nconcepts (e.g., 111,18-27). We see no secure way to sort out the material in this chapter \r\nwhich may go back to the original Paulisa.\r\nThe Paulisasiddhanta was apparently based on an Hellenistic source, and Paulisa \r\nmay represent the Greek TTauAos; but he certainly had nothing to do with the astro￾loger Paulus Alexandrinus who wrote the Eiaaycoyri in A.I). 37815. The identification \r\ndepends on al-Biruni’s misreading in the India (see fragment P 1 of the later Pauli￾sasiddhanta) of T.n.y.s.r. in Arabic (for Sthanvisvara, the locality at which the later \r\nPaulisasiddhanta was written) as S.y.n.t.r; the only difference in Arabic script is in \r\nthe positioning of the dots. Al-Biruni corrects himself in a later Maqala (see fragment \r\nP 41 of the later Paulisasiddhanta). Moreover, Paulus Alexandrinus the astrologer is\r\n18 See D. Pingree, \"The Later Pauliéasiddhånta”, Centaurus 14, 1969, 172-241 and also Isis 54,1963,\r\n237 n. 63.",

This attribution may well be correct. There is more doubt about the \r\ncolophon of chapter XVII, which ascribes the planetary theory of XVII,65-80 to the \r\nPaulisasiddhanta though Varaham ihira in XVII,61-64 claims it for himself. In favor \r\nof the Paulisa as the source of this section is the Babylonian character of the theory.\r\nIn the eighth century another Paulisasiddhanta was written, which is essentially \r\nardharatrika. It is this work to which, e.g. Prthudakasvam in, Utpala, and al-Biruni \r\nrefer. Its fragments are gathered and discussed in the article mentioned in footnote 15.\r\nV. The Suryasiddhanta\r\nVaraham ihira speaks of Latadeva as a commentator on the Paulisa and Romaka, \r\nbut says nothing of the name of any original work of his. We believe that he wrote the \r\nSuryasiddhanta summarized in the Pancasiddhantika. Such a tradition was known \r\nto al-BIrunl (India, ed. p. 118, trans. vol. 1, p. 153). The param eters of this work \r\nbelong to the ardharatrika system which, as Brahmagupta tells us (Kandakhadyaka \r\n1,1), was promulgated by Aryabhata; and Bhaskara, commenting on the Aryabhatlya \r\n(Kalakriya 10) in 629, names Pandurangasvam in, Latadeva, and Nihsanku as pupils \r\nto whom Aryabhata directly expounded astronomy.\r\nOn the assumption of Latadeva’s authorship of this Suryasiddhanta, Pahca￾siddhantika 1,8-15 appears as a unit summarizing Latadeva’s rules for determining \r\nthe ahargana for a given calendar date with respect to his chosen epoch; 1,14 gives \r\nthe rules for the Suryasiddhanta, based on the same param eters as are IX ,1-2; IX \r\n(on solar eclipses) is attributed to the Suryasiddhanta in both the first verse and in \r\nthe colophon. It, however, gives the epoch as noon at Avanll rather than as midnight. \r\nSince this is not an error in the text, it is a reflection of an earlier version of the Surya￾siddhanta using noon epoch.\r\nThe identity of param eters shows that chapter X (on lunar eclipses) is also \r\nfrom the Suryasiddhanta. And finally XVI (on the planets) is stated in verse 1 and \r\nafter verse 11 to be from the Suryasiddhanta; the statement is confirmed by this \r\nchapter’s use of ardharatrika parameters.\r\nThe epoch of this ardharatrika version of the Suryasiddhanta is midnight of \r\n20/21 March 505 in XVI. But in IX there is evidence of an earlier Suryasiddhanta \r\nusing noon epoch and slightly different param eters for the mean motion of the Moon, \r\nlunar apogee, and ascending node. The k§epas in IX ,1-5 are computed for noon of \r\n20 March 505. We assume that it was Latadeva who computed these ksepas, added \r\nthe corrections in IX,4 and who authored the source of XVI. Another possible reflection \r\nof this earlier Suryasiddhanta is the rule for computing the kak§as and diameters of",

The underlying assumptions of the other \r\nardharatrika texts for the solution of this problem (see, e.g., M ahabhaskariya VII, \r\n23-24 and fragment P 59 of the later Paulisasiddhanta) are missing. And the method \r\nemploys the true hypotenuse, which, according to IX,7-8, is not involved in the \r\npresent text’s computation of the m anda equation as one would expect if it is to be \r\nused in the later passage.\r\nOne Satananda wrote a Bhasvati whose epoch is Saka 1021 or A.D. 1099. This \r\nwork he claims to be based on the Suryasiddhanta taught by (V araha)m ihira (vs. 6). \r\nThis work has not been utilized in our discussion of the Pancasiddhantika; but the \r\nfact that it contains a section of the projection of eclipses indicates that Satananda \r\nprobably considered Pancasiddhantika XI to be from the Suryasiddhanta.\r\nVI.

A ryabhata’s pupil Latadeva16 appears in XV, 18, where his epoch is stated \r\nto be sunset at Yavanapura (Alexandria); this is the Rom aka’s epoch (1,18).

X III,5):\r\n“ As from this region, so in all directions does the circle of the constellations \r\nrise up; it leaves a center of fixedness (i.e., the pole). This (axial) line splits the sur￾face of the earth; like a cloud in an extensive plain a star stands above it20.”\r\nA half-verse of Läta quoted by Prthüdakasväm in on Brähm asphutasiddhänta \r\nX X I,8a-b is comparable to Pancasiddhäntikä X III,27a-b:\r\n“ For a half of a year the Sun, having risen once, is seen by the Gods21.” \r\nFinally, Sankara in his commentary on B äna’s Harsacarita22 quotes an äryä \r\ndefining vyatlpäta as Läta’s:\r\n“ For when, in the heavens, the Sun and Moon are together in one märga (i.e., \r\nsemicircle between equinoxes) and when (the longitude of) the Sun and (that of) \r\nthe Moon equal half of a revolution (i.e., 180°), then there occurs vyatlpäta23.”\r\nc. The influence of V araham ihira’s Iranian (Maga) ancestors, which perhaps \r\nreached him through his father and teacher Ädityadäsa, is found in 1,23-25; the guru \r\nof the Yavanas in XV, 19 is perhaps a Sasanian astronomer. Simha, who is also \r\nmentioned in XV, 19, is referred to again only by Brahmagupta (B rähm asphutasid￾dhänta XI,46-47).

The Pancasiddhantika in later literature\r\nThe first author to demonstrate a knowledge of the Pancasiddhantika is B rahm a￾gupta in his Brahm asphutasiddhanta (1,13; XIV,46-49; and XXIV,2-3), which was \r\nwritten at Bhillamala in A.D. 628. It is from the Brahm asphutasiddhanta and its \r\ncommentary-tradition that al-Birunl (India, ed. pp. 118-119, trans. vol. 1, p. 153; \r\nthis is Paulisa frag. P I ) knows of the five siddhantas. In Brahmagupta s Khandakha￾dyaka, written in A.D. 665, the fractions by which the ahargana is to be multiplied \r\nto find the mean longitudes of several of the planets are identical with those in the \r\nSuryasiddhanta of the Pancasiddhantika; but both sets may be independently de￾rived from their common ardharatrika parameters.\r\nIn A.D. 718 an Indian, C hufan Hsita, produced a work entitled Chiuchih-li at \r\nthe T ’ang court. The Chiuchih-li, whose epoch is A.D. 714, is said to be based on \r\nmethods devised by Brahma and inherited by WuPung Hsienjen, “ the excellent \r\nscholar of full understanding of five.” This seems to be a reference to the Pancasid￾dhantika. A num ber of passages in the Chinese work can be paralleled in our text, \r\nthough it is clear that ChliPan Hsita’s source was based on other texts besides the \r\nPancasiddhantika; he uses, e.g., R = 3438 rather than R = 120.\r\nThe parallel passages are as follows:\r\nI. The computation of the ahargana (pp. 499-502). The Chiuchih-li uses formulas \r\nwhich are the equivalents, with suitable substitutions for the new epoch, of the for￾mulas in 1,9-11 (Romaka).\r\nII. The computation of the mean longitudes of the Sun, lunar apogee, and lunar ano￾maly (pp. 502-505). The rules in the Chiuchih-li are based on the param eters in \r\nIX ,11-12 (Surya).\r\nIII. The computation of the solar and lunar equations (pp. 506-511). This passage is \r\nderived from IX,7 (Surya).\r\nIV. The computation of the length of daylight (pp. 511-513). The Chiuchih-li depends \r\non 111,10 (Paulisa).\r\nV. The determination of the daily progress of the Moon (p. 514). See III,9 (Paulisa).\r\nVI. The determination of the daily progress of the Sun (p. 515). See 111,17 (Paulisa).\r\nVII.

  "19": "Nr. 1 17\r\nIn A.D. 864 Prthudakasvam in of Sthanvisvara wrote a commentary on Brahm a￾gupta’s K handakhadyaka in which he refers to his already existing commentary on \r\nthe B rahm asphutasiddhanta. In this second commentary he quotes several verses \r\nfrom chapter XIII of the Pancasiddhantika24. Utpala, apparently a Kasmirian, wrote \r\na com m entary on V araham ihira’s Brhatsamhita in A.D. 966 in which he quotes 117 \r\nof the Pancasiddhantika’s 443 verses25. Al-Biruni, when he composed the India in \r\n1030, knew of the Pancasiddhantika only from his Panjabi panditas, whose infor￾mation was evidently derived from Brhatsam hita II (p. 22) and from a commentary \r\non the Brahm asphutasiddhanta26; he had no m anuscript of the text. Satananda in \r\n1099, at an unknown locality27, wrote the Bhasvati allegedly based on the param eters \r\nand methods of V araham ihira’s Suryasiddhanta. And a Jaina author, M akkibhatta, \r\nwrote in W estern India in the late fourteenth century a commentary on the Siddhan￾tasekhara of Sripati in which he quotes several verses from the Pancasiddhantika28. \r\nSo far there is no indisputable evidence that the Pancasiddhantika was known out￾side of an area roughly corresponding to the m odern states of Madhya Pradesh, \r\nGujarat, Rajasthan, the Panjab, Kashmir, and West Pakistan.\r\nHowever, some verses from the text are quoted by fifteenth century Kerala \r\nastronomers of the drgganita school in their commentaries on the Aryabhatiya. Thus \r\nParam esvara (c. 1380-1460) cites a verse29, and Nilakantha (b. 1443) several others30. \r\nIt is noteworthy that all four verses that they quote are also found in Utpala’s com￾mentary on the Brhatsam hita, which was known in Kerala; it is not proved, then, \r\nthat they had a copy of the Pancasiddhantika.\r\nThe m anuscript tradition also supports the theory that the Pancasiddhantika \r\nwas never known outside of W estern and Northern India. All known m anuscripts \r\nare descended from two copies of the text, which in turn are derived from a common, \r\nlacunose m anuscript. The older of the two was copied in Stam bhatlrtha (Cambay) \r\nin 1616, while the other was in Sojitra in Gujarat in the 1870’s. Its then owner claimed \r\nthat it was copied from a m anuscript in Benares, where other manuscripts of the text \r\nand a comm entary were available31. No such other m anuscripts have ever turned up, \r\nhowever, despite the extensive work in cataloguing private and forming public m anu￾script collections that has been carried on in Benaras between 1873 and the present. \r\nWe therefore doubt the story of a Benares provenience, and assume that the Sojitra \r\nm anuscript represents a Gujarati tradition.\r\na4.T h ey are X III, 2-3, 5-6, 9,12,27, and 35.\r\n26 1,1,8-10, and 16-22; 11,13; 111,1,10,21, and 25; IV,20-23,27-28,30-33,35-36,38,41-44, and 48-49;\r\nV ,l-10; VI,9-10 and 15; V III,1 and 9-18; IX ,1; X II,1-3; X III,1-34 and 39-42; XIV,33 and 39-40; XV,15\r\nand 18-29; and XVI,15-16.\r\n26 See Paulina frag.

Biihler, who noticed the Sojitra m anuscript in his tour in search of Sanskrit m anu￾scripts undertaken on behalf of the Government of the Presidency of Bombay in \r\n1873/74. The Cambay m anuscript was procured in 1879/80, and copies of the two \r\nm anuscripts (probably our D and E, now in the National Library in Calcutta) were \r\nsent to G. Thibaut in Benares, who collaborated with S. Dvivedin in attempting to \r\ninterpret them.\r\nThe first results of their labors on the text were published in 188432, in which \r\nparticular attention was paid to the Surya and Romaka siddhantas. The following \r\nverses were edited, translated, and discussed: 1,1-10 and 14-15; 111,13; V III,1,4-5, \r\n7a-b and 8; IX,1-4; XV,19; and XVI,1-11. Also cited are Brahm asphutasiddhanta\r\nI, 13 and XI,47-50b. From all of this they correctly concluded that none of the five \r\nsiddhantas summ arized by Varaham ihira is presently extant.\r\nTheir m ain publication with regard to the Pancasiddhantika was an edition of \r\nthe text with English translation and Sanskrit and English commentaries, which ap￾peared at Benares in 188933, The inherent difficulties of a technical text without a \r\ncommentary and the corruption of the manuscripts, while frequently overcome, at \r\nmany points obstructed their understanding of the work. It would serve no purpose to \r\ndiscuss here in detail our disagreements with their interpretations.\r\nIn the year 1890 S. B. Dikshit34, using a m anuscript copied by Janardan Balaji \r\nModak, Head Master of the Thana High School, from the copy of the Sojitra m anu￾script which we have denoted B35, discusses the chronological implications of 1,8 \r\nand 14; IX ,1-4; XV,18 and 20; and XVI,10-11. Dikshit concludes that the epoch of \r\nVaraham ihira is Tuesday 22 March 505, but that, according to the Suryasiddhanta, \r\nthe ksepakas in IX, 1-4 are for noon of Sunday 20 March, and the ksepakas in XVI, \r\n10-11 are for midnight of 20/21 March in the same year.\r\nIn the same year Dikshit published a second article38 devoted to the Romaka￾siddhanta, in which he discusses 1,3 and 15; III, 1; and V III,1-5 and 8. He also dis￾cusses the Rom akasiddhanta as known from Brahm asphutasiddhanta 1,13; XIV,46; \r\nand XXIV,2-3, and Srlsena (and Visnucandra) in Brahm asphutasiddhanta 1,62;\r\nII, 46-47; X,13; XI,31,46-50, and 55; XVI,36; XXI,38-39; and X X II,2. He concludes \r\nthat Srisena was not the author of the Rom akasiddhanta sum m arized by Varaha￾mihira, that the ksepakas in V III,1,4-5, and 8 are computed for sunset of 20 March \r\n505, and that this is not the epoch of the original Rom akasiddhanta, which he claims \r\nwas written between the time of Hipparchus and A.D. 150 as it uses the Hipparchan \r\nlength of year and says nothing of the calculation of the longitudes of the planets,\r\n38 G.

Burgess38 compares the \r\nRom aka’s luni-solar param eters with those of Ptolemy and contends that Hipparchus \r\nhad a planetary theory. In the following year he claim ed39 that the table of sines in \r\nIV,6-11 is closely related to the Ptolemaic table of chords and may have been derived \r\nfrom it.\r\nIn 1895 M. P.

B. M odak of Thana which was copied from B, and we know of a m anuscript \r\n(no. 6674) of the Pancasiddhantika in the Anandasram a in Poona. The manuscripts \r\nrecorded as the property of Sjt. Puspachandra Sarma Daloi of Helach in Assam and \r\nof the Arsha Library in Vijayanagara (no. 506) probably contain the Bhasvatl of \r\nSatananda, which is sometimes confused with our text.\r\nThe archetypes of a and (3 (henceforth denoted simply a and (3) were derived \r\nfrom a common original. This is shown by their sharing not only numerous errors, \r\nbut also several lacunae (e.g., IV,43c-45b and VI,9). In general a is more correct, \r\nbut neither gives any evidence that its scribe understood the material he was copying. \r\nAside from their respective readings, each class is distinguished by lacunae peculiar \r\nto itself. Thus a omits X III,3d-4d and (3 IV,18b-V,9c, X III,1 lc-12d, and XVII,6c-7c. \r\nMoreover, (3 transposes XIV,33a-XV,7d (16 verses) so that they follow XV,24a48.\r\nUtpala had a fuller text than do we; he knew IV,43c-44d and VI,9. There are \r\nprobably other verses which were in the original text and which were not in the arche￾type of a and |3 and were not quoted by Utpala. See, for instance, Brahmasphuta￾siddhanta XIV,46-49 and note that Varaham ihira in Brhatsamhita XVII,1 says that \r\nhe has dealt with planetary conflicts (transits) according to the Suryasiddhanta in his \r\nkarana. Unfortunately, as useful as Utpala’s quotations are, they do not contribute \r\nnow all that they might to our knowledge of the text. This is due to the fact that we \r\ndo not yet have a critical edition of Utpala’s commentary on the Brhatsamhita, but \r\nonly a text prepared by Thibaut’s collaborator, Dvivedin. Dvivedin was certainly \r\ninfluenced by the readings adopted in his edition of the Pancasiddhantika; thus, in \r\nhis edition where Utpala quotes 1,8, he prints somadivasadye which is the emendation \r\nhe and Thibaut suggested for a ’s saum ya0 and P’s bhaum ya0; but Dikshit had a copy \r\nof Utpala in which bhaum a0 was read. In our apparatus, then, Utpala refers to Dvi￾vedin’s text and not necessarily to that tenth century scholiast.\r\n48 These 16 verses must have occupied 1 or 2 folios of |3, which have obviously been misplaced. This\r\nproves that all (3 manuscripts go back to a single archetype, probably the Sojltra manuscript.",

Those who know Srisena, Aryabhata, and Visnucandra, when they see \r\none who (really) knows mean motion, do not stand and face him publicly as horses, \r\nwhen they see a lion, do not stand and face him.\r\nII, 46-47. At the beginning of a yuga the true longitudes for Aryabhata, Mars \r\nand so on (i.e., the star-planets) for Srisena, and all the planets for Visnucandra do \r\nnot start out from the beginning of Aries. Since the true (longitudes of) Mars and so \r\non have fallen far away (from the truth) in (the treatises) of Srisena, Aryabhata, and \r\nVisnucandra, they are not respected by the wise.\r\nX,13. For one observing (heliacal risings and settings) every day at sunrise \r\nor sunset and (making the calculations) described by Srisena, Aryabhata, and Visnu￾candra, there is no unity of observation and computation.\r\nX, 62. Even though one knows the tantras (written by) Aryabhata, Visnucandra, \r\nand so on, he is not a teacher; but he who knows the B rahm a’s operations in the dust \r\n(i.e., computations) has attained the status of a teacher.\r\nXI, 3. The Jina says that there are 54 naksatras, two Suns, and two Moons and \r\nthat days are caused by the revolution of the dhruvam atsya; this is false.\r\nXI,31. Since Srl§ena and Visnucandra compute solar eclipses with the five \r\nsines (the agra, the madhyajya, the ravisanku, the drggati, and the drkksepa), they \r\nshare in the errors with respect to solar eclipses which have been enunciated by \r\nAryabhata.\r\nXI,46-47. Ignorance is doubled every day by the disagreements of Srisena, \r\nVisnucandra, Pradyum na, Aryabhata, Lata, and Simha regarding eclipses and so on. \r\nThe mistakes singly pronounced by Aryabhata are properly to be considered the \r\nfaults of Srisena and the rest; I shall now mention some other faults.\r\nXI,48-51. Srisena took the mean (motions of the) Moon and Sun and the \r\nMoon’s apogee and node from Lata; the mean (motions of) Mars, M ercury’s sighra, \r\nJupiter, Venus’ sighra, and Saturn (and their) revolutions in the years that have pas￾sed of the yuga from the Vasi§tha, (and?) from the chapter (p ad a) composed by \r\nVijayanandin; and the apogees, epicycles, computation of true longitudes, and so on \r\nfrom Aryabhata. Thus he made the Romaka, which was a clothes-binding knot (?),",

Visnucandra, taking these same (elements), m ade the Vasistha. \r\nIn these two (works) there is never any agreement between observation and calcula￾tion with regard to eclipses and so on; whatever agreement there is is a happy chance. \r\nTherefore, what use are these two inaccurate (siddhantas)?\r\nXI,52. The center of the circle of perigee and apogee is called the “ apogee” \r\nby the stranger to the sphere49; as the apogee is not there he does not know the apogee.\r\nXI,53. Since (the planets) had various latitudes at the beginning of the Mahayuga \r\nand their true longitudes were (their mean longitudes) increased by the equations due \r\nto the various positions of their apogees, therefore the (fixed) nodes and apogees (in \r\nsome siddhantas) are not correct.\r\nXI,54. The most and fewest nadls are respectively in daylight and in night-time \r\n(when the Sun is) at the end of Gemini (in the tropical zodiac); the rtus depend on \r\nthe motion of the Sun (in the sidereal zodiac). There is no yuga for the ayana due to \r\nits (m otion); but both ayanas are fixed50.\r\nXI,55. That which is called a mahayuga by Srlsena, Visnucandra, and others, \r\nbut which is outside of the (system of) yugas, is stupid because at the beginning of \r\nthe m ahayuga there are minutes of drggati in the case of the planets (i.e., the planets \r\nare not at the beginning of Aries).\r\nXI,56. It is said in the smrtis that the creation of the planets and constellations \r\noccurs at the beginning of a day of Brahma, their dissolution at its end. As there are \r\nvery many (of their m ahayugas) in this mahayuga, this (system of theirs) is incomplete.\r\nXI,57-58. Because of the daily diasgreement (with observation) (of the longi￾tudes) of the planets, tithis, karanas, naksatras, days, and months in such things as \r\neclipses and planetary conjunctions, who would touch a chapter (pada) with his foot \r\n(pada)? As the lowest (pada) karanas are those of the stigmatized (ankaciti51), Vi￾jayanandin, Pradyum na, and so on, their errors will not be written down here.\r\nXIV,46-49. The calculation of the naksatras that is described in the Paulisa, \r\nRomaka, Vasistha, Saura, and Paitam aha (siddhantas)52 is not mentioned by Arya￾bhata; therefore it is described (here). Six naksatras are one and a half sized, six \r\nare half sized, and fifteen are equal sized; there is one bhoga of Abhijit. The (first) \r\nsix are Kesa (i.e., Sravana) Aditya (i.e., Punarvasu), Visakha, Prosthapada (i.e., \r\nB hadrapada), Aryamna (i.e., Uttaraphalguni), and Vaisvadeva (i.e., Uttarasadha); \r\nthe (second) six are Jyestha, Bharani, Svati, Ardra, Varuna (i.e., Satabhisaj), and \r\nAslesa. The fifteen are not named here, and the one other nak§atrabhoga is called \r\nAbhijit, because this naksatra is difficult to learn for the slow-witted.\r\nXVI,36. Since the eclipse falls far off (from the truth) in (the works of) Srlsena, \r\nAryabhata, and Visnucandra, because of the disagreement of calculation (with ob￾servation), (any) agreement is accidental.\r\n49 The “stranger to the sphere” is identified as Aryabhata by Prthudakasvamin.\r\n50 Prthudakasvamin here quotes a verse from Visnucandra’s Vasisthasiddhanta regarding precession;\r\nsee above p. 1 1 .\r\n61 Literally, “he who has a multitude of stigmata” ; Prthudakasvamin identifies him with Aryabhata.\r\n52 The passage no longer survives in our Pancasiddhantika.",

(This) additional chapter on eclipses is not to be given away, even \r\nwith curses for the destruction of someone’s good fortune; the (original) section on \r\neclipses, since (it follows the treatises of) Aryabhata, Srlsena, and so on, is not accurate.\r\nXXI, 37-39. “ If Rahu obscures the Moon from the east, why does he not obscure \r\nthe Sun thus? Why is there not so long a duration of a solar eclipse as there is of a \r\nlunar eclipse? How can the Sun pervade (all) objects and Rahu be something else? \r\nSince there is a difference of obscuration in a solar eclipse, solar and lunar eclipses \r\nare not caused by R ahu.” (This opinion expressed) by V araham ihira, Srlsena, Arya￾bhata, Visnucandra, and others is opposed to popular beliefs and is foreign to the \r\nVedas, smrtis, and samhitas.\r\nXXII, 2. Since the sphere was not understood by teachers such as Srlsena, \r\nAryabhata, and Visnucandra, the B rahm a’s sphere was made accurate.\r\nXXIV,2-3. The beginning of the yuga is simultaneously from sunrise in the \r\nsouth, from midnight in the west, from sunset in the north, and from noon in the \r\neast: just this was done by Surya, Indu (i.e., Soma), Pulisa, Rom aka, Vasistha, Ya￾vana, and so on.

I will explain the cal￾culation for other places.\r\n111.14. Multiply the sum of the yojanas (between the localities) by 9, divide (the \r\nproduct) by 80, and square (the result); subtract from this the square of the difference \r\nbetween the two latitudes (of the two localities); the square-root (of the rem ainder) \r\ndivided by 6 are the nadis (of the longitudinal difference).\r\n111.15. Subtract half the nadis of ascensional difference from the nadis of longitudinal \r\ndifference in the first half of the zodiac, add them in the second. One should ignore \r\nany fraction of them (?).\r\n111.16. A naksatra is 800 minutes. A tithi (is known) from (the longitude of) the \r\nMoon dim inished by (that of) the Sun (being divided) by 12°. The limit (of a nak￾satra) is a consequence of the daily progress (of the Moon). (The limit) of a tithi is \r\nderived from the difference between the daily progresses of the Sun and Moon.\r\n111.17. The daily progress of the Sun (in each of the zodiacal signs) is in order 60 \r\n(minutes) minus 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1; plus 1, 1, 1, 1; and minus 0, 1.\r\n111.18. In the suklapak§a 6° are subtracted, in the krsnapaksa they are added. The \r\nminutes of the Moon (so modified and) diminished by the longitude of the Sun (are \r\nto be divided) by 360; the result is the karana. The rest is like a tithi.\r\n4*",

The dhruva-square is diminished by (the \r\nsquare of the Sine) of Aries; the square-root is the Sine for two zodiacal signs (i.e., 60°).\r\nIV,3. W hen the remaining (Sines) are desired, the radius is diminished by the Sine \r\nof the rem ainder of the subtraction of twice the arc from a quadrant; the square of \r\nhalf of that (rem ainder) is to be added to the square of half (the Sine) of double \r\n(the arc).\r\nIV,4.
