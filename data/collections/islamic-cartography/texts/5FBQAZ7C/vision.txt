Tradition and Innovation in the Cosmology
of Anania Širakac'i

Abstract Anania Širakac‘i was a 7th century AD Armenian mathematician trained in the Byzantine
Empire whose works embrace treatises in various fields of science. Of the almost 30 texts attrib-
uted to him, most await investigation. His Cosmology is the focus of our research, and we highlight
its elements of similarity with Greek tradition, in particular with St Basil's Hexameron, and in the
Armenian tradition, to which Anania brings novelty especially in his deeper understanding of astro-
nomical phenomena. We suggest that this work, like Isidore's De Natura Rerum, represents a new
genre of Christian literature, and attempts to understand it through the meaning of Cosmos found
in Aristotle's De Mundo.

1 Introduction
Anania Širakac'i, also known as Anania of Širak or Anania Širakuni, is
regarded within the Armenian tradition as the father of mathematical
sciences. Active in the 7th century AD, he is considered the first Armenian
scholar to have imported a set of scientific notions, and examples of
their applications, from the Greek-speaking schools into ‘early Medieval'
Armenia. Writings attributed to him cover a vast array of subjects, including
amongst others, arithmetic, computation, astronomy, astrology and natural
philosophy. According to tradition, his writings and teachings are the heart
of the autonomous development of these fields in the Armenian language,
and, significantly, statues of him have been erected in prominent public
spaces in the Armenian capital, Yerevan. Nevertheless, studies on this
scholar are still at a relatively early stage: the exact form and breadth
of his works is not yet established with certainty despite the survival of
a large number of manuscripts carrying texts attributed to him. As it

is often the case with Armenian codices, surviving copies are late and
miscellaneous, adding difficulty to the already arduous identification of a
homogeneous body of works.
After a small introduction of what is known about Anania Širakac'i's
education and scholarly formation, we shall give a brief account of the
information we have been able to gather on his known attributed works,
warning the reader that we have relied on secondary literature and do not
wish to make claims over the texts' authorship, but rather to report data as
it stands at the moment. Once this background is set, we shall move on to
the main focus of this paper, the Tiezeragitut'iwn (Shuqtɲuqhup) or
Cosmology attributed to Anania Širakacʻi, with a special emphasis on the
aspects of this work which belong to a traceable tradition and those that
might represent an innovation, especially in regard to Armenian science.
We shall also point to some elements of this work that deserve deeper
examination.
2 The Autobiography and Anania's Alexandrian formation
Anania's Autobiography (Þûpâшччûùшqɲníðþíù) Ink‘nakensagrut'iwn
offers information - about his development as a scholar and about his
career - which helps to date his active period. It is a first-hand account
of a mathematician's education in the seventh century, and his formation
in the Byzantine Empire, where this Armenian scholar sought a suitable
teacher. Anania himself tells us:
I desired to pursue philosophy. I was particularly lacking in the science
of mathematics, since I reckoned that nothing could be worked out
without numbers, esteeming [this science] the mother of all knowledge.
(Transl. Greenwood 2011, 138)¹
What features most prominently is information relevant to his studies and
education, so that we are told of his first instruction on Armenian literature
and the Scriptures.
Since no-one could be found in this country of Armenia who knew philoso-
phy, and not even books of the sciences could be found anywhere, [...] I
made my way to the country of the Greeks. (Transl. Greenwood 2011, 138)
In Theodosiopolis, Anania was advised to find a mathematician named
K'ristosatur, but only six months later he decided to look for a more sat-

isfactory teacher, and headed to Constantinople. On his way, he crossed
paths with some friends of his who recommended that he go to Trebizond,
where a master could accept him as a student.
Here this Autobiography includes another story, that of the life and
curriculum of Tychicos, Anania's instructor for eight years. We are in-
formed that he could speak and write in Armenian, a skill he acquired
while campaigning in Armenia under a Byzantine general. He then trav-
elled to Jerusalem in search of science and learning, spent three years in
Alexandria, some time in Rome, and finally lived and studied many years
in Constantinople. Says Anania of Tychicos:
[In Constantinople] he encountered a celebrated figure, a master from
Athens, city of philosophers. [...] a few years later the master died and
none of his pupils were found to be of the same level in order to succeed
to his position. They begged the much-missed Tychikos to come and take
his place. (transl. Greenwood 2011, 141)
The identity of this most revered master is uncertain. Greenwood discusses
the possibility that this scholar may be Stephanos of Alexandria, based
on the hypothesis argued by Wolska-Conus that a certain Stephanos of
Athens should be identified with the same Stephanos of Alexandria, in-
vited to Constantinople by the emperor Heraclius to revive the teaching
of mathematical sciences (Greenwood 2011, 149; Wolska-Conus 1989).
The importance of this possible connection with Alexandria should not
be underestimated, for it might help position this scholar within the broad-
er context of scientific teaching in Western Europe, where the Alexandrian
techniques for calendrical computations were being adopted or rejected
to different degrees (see Warntjes 2010, xxx-xxxiii). We thus expect Ana-
nia's writings on astronomical tables and computations of religious feasts
to be especially significant to our understanding of these mathematical
sciences and their application in this period. We are equally hopeful that
comparisons of works on natural philosophy shall bear interesting fruit
and enhance our understanding of the transmission of ideas in this cen-
tury. However, a careful re-assessment and analysis of Anania's attributed
corpus has to be addressed one item at a time.
3 The Corpus of Anania's works
A formidable reputation as a polymath is unsurprisingly bestowed on Ana-
nia Širakac'i, due to the array of topics covered by the surviving works
attributed to him. Although our present paper is only going to focus on
the Cosmology, we shall very briefly to assess the state of philological
research on this author. The most extensive assessment of his work was
