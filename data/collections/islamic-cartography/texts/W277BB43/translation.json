    "3": "THE CLASSICAL EPISTOLARY ROMANCE PRESERVED IN THE ARABIC VERSION OF SALIM ABU-L-'ALA' In 1959, we had been commissioned by Professor R.Morghen, president of the «Istituto Storico Italiano per il Medioevo», to prepare a monograph on the Latin version of the «Kitab-ae-eiyasa fi tadblri-r-ri'asa, al-ma'rfifi bi Sirr-al-asrar» 1, the only Arabic «siyasatnamah» known to the medieval West. Despite its lack of originality—Steinschneider had even defined it as «eine teilweisemiserable Compilation philosophierender Mystik und vulgaren Aberglaubens» 2—the «Sirr-al-asrar» had, as is known, an extraordinary success among the Latins, attested by the two hundred manuscripts and more still existing today in libraries, and by the numerous translations into the most diverse languages of Europe. For this reason—Steinschneider himself had admitted it—this work merited a particular study. However, our preparatory work advanced very slowly, especially for a psychological reason. While working to collect and collate the texts of the Arabic versions and the translations into Latin and vernacular languages, we had the precise feeling of dealing with a text reworked by a relatively recent Arab writer, who would have suppressed the properly political part of this «siyasatnamah» to graft onto it long chapters on magic, medicine, and physiognomy. Only the encouragement lavished by Professor Morghen prevented us from abandoning a work we deemed sterile. The numerous modern studies of this work, unanimous or nearly so in attributing the «Sirr-al-asrar» to Yuhanna-bnu Batriq, helped us very little. Thus we took as the basis of our research the chapter dedicated to this «siyasatnamah» by Steinschneider in his book «Die hebraischen Uebersetzungen aus dem Arabischen», a veritable mine of information J-\"\"\"\" ~'1 1 Published by Prof. 'Adburrahman Badawi under the title ;YU~ I i)\"~1 ~ ~l::-JI .::..4)i;.U Cairo, 1954. 2 STEINSCHNEIDER, Die Hebrdischen.

    "4": "bibliographical references, which led us to concentrate our attention on two works: that of the «Iḫwān-aṣ-ṣafā'» and the «Faraḫnāmah» of Manṣūr Nawālī, a Turkish scholar from the late 16th century.\n\nThe study of the treatise of the «Iḫwān-aṣ-ṣafā'» definitively confirmed our impression that the «Sirr-al-asrār» could not be earlier than the 11th century. It appeared to us that only a methodological error had led to recognising a greater antiquity for it. Influenced, unknowingly, by the preface of this work, the scholars who had dealt with it had always considered the presence of passages parallel to the «Sirr-al-asrār» in the works of the «Iḫwān-aṣ-ṣafā» and of Ibn 'Abdi Rabbihi as proof that these authors already knew our pseudo-Aristotelian treatise 3. In fact, this reasoning had to be reversed, and it was on the contrary the author of the «Sirr-al-asrār» who had drawn from these encyclopedias in order to enrich his own text 4.\n\nAs for the Faraḫnāmah of Manṣūr Nawālī, which we studied during a long stay in Istanbul in 1961 5, it revealed itself to be a compilation of a heterogeneous character, for which Nawālī had\n\n3 For example, see STEINSCHNEIDER, p. 257 and note 1076.\n\n4 In order to establish this, one only has to read, in the version of Manṣūr Nawālī (ms. Hafiz ef.-Süleymaniye 253, fol. 63 v), the beginning of the «bāb» of the «Kitāb-as-siyāsa fī tadbīr-i-r-ri'āsa» on «the qualities and number of viziers, as well as the manner of testing their intelligence and their views». The author, who was certainly not a philosopher, cited at the head of this «bāb» the principle stated by the «Iḫwān-aṣ-ṣafā» in the 1st «risāla» of Book III, namely that it is indispensable to know oneself before the things of the world (Bombay ed., vol. III, p. 9, l. 4-7). After which, he continued by copying pages 7, l. 24-end; 8, l. 1; 9, l. 7-9; 11, l. 27-end; 12, l. 1-2; 13, l. 8-22, of this same «risāla». In this way, he happened, inadvertently, to attribute to the universal soul the powers proper, according to the «Iḫwān-aṣ-ṣafā», to the vegetative soul governing the foetus. —For his part, the author of the «Sirr-al-asrār» proceeded in exactly the same way. He added to the extracts from the encyclopedia of the «Iḫwān-aṣ-ṣafā» chosen by his predecessor a passage from page 8 (l. 1-18 and 20-26) of the same «risāla»; he replaced the invitation to know oneself before the things of the world at the place where it appears in the encyclopedia; but above all he omitted lines 21-22 of p. 13, perhaps because they implied the principle of metempsychosis. Finally, he added to these pages the paraphrase of some extracts from the IVth «risāla» of Book III and from the Xth «risāla» of Book II. But he did not notice the gross error that existed in his model and continued to attribute to the universal soul the powers proper to the vegetative soul!\n\n5 At the Saray Library, we found two mss. of this work: ms. Hazine 364 by the scribe Meḥmed Bostanzade, copied in 1050 h., and ms. Emin Hazine 1349.",
    "5": "employed accounts about the history of Alexander, accounts of the kind of legends collected by Bal'aml and al-Mubassir Ibn Fatik, and a text related to the « Sirr-al-asrar », but which must have presented very remarkable differences. Now, we were fortunate enough to find in ms. 253 Ḥāfiẓ Efendi (Süleymaniye) the Turkish translation by the same Nawālī of these legends and of this text, entitled « Kitāb as-siyāsa fī tadbīr ir-ri'āsa », that is to say that it bore the title which, in all Arabic mss., appears at the head of the « Sirr-al-asrar ». It immediately appeared to us that the identity of titles was not the result of a simple coincidence. One had only to peruse the book translated by Nawālī to be convinced that it represented the original version of the « Sirr-al-asrar ». We then continued our research in the libraries of Istanbul in the hope of finding the Arabic text. They remained unsuccessful, but led us to the discovery of two other volumes: ms. Aya Sofya 4260 and ms. Köprülü 1608, the latter, we were unaware at the time, already studied by Kraemer. Both contained a treatise the « as-Siyāsat-al-'āmmīya » which is also found in Arabic ms. 2422 of the Bibliothèque Nationale de Paris. Of course, this latter ms. had not escaped Steinschneider; but this scholar had relied on the catalogue indication, according to which it was a simple variant of the « Sirr-al-asrar ». On the contrary, already according to a superficial examination, the « as-Siyāsat-al-'āmmīya » revealed itself to be an even older version of the « Sirr-al-asrar », and more precisely the source of this « Kitāb-as-siyāsa », which Nawālī had translated into Turkish. And what is more, in the context of ms. Aya Sofya 4260, this « as-Siyāsat-al-'āmmīya » acquired a new significance. It came to constitute the centrepiece of an Arabic epistolary novel, deriving, quite evidently, from a Hellenistic original, connected in some way to the Romance of ps-Callisthenes. From then on, we concentrated our attention on this latter ms. Its study took us a very long time. In the meantime, the publication by Professor Stern of his study on the Arabic translations of the Περὶ Κόσμου 6 revealed to us the existence in Istanbul of ms. Fātiḥ 5323, equal in its content to ms. Aya Sofya 4260, and drew our attention to the passages in the « Kitāb at-tanbīh wa-l-isrāf » p. 202-203 and the « Kitāb-al-buldān » of Ibn-al-Faqīh p. 160. And what is more, it",
    "6": "allowed us to re-examine the results of our own research in light of the conclusions that Professor Stern had reached. From then on, it seemed necessary to us to prove what we had considered evident: namely that the two Istanbul manuscripts did not transmit to us a simple collection by a Muslim author of pseudo-Aristotelian letters, but rather a Hellenistic epistolary novel reworked by an Arab writer of the Umayyad period. This demonstration will constitute the subject of our article. Also, so as not to exceed its limits, we will set aside the problems, equally important, that this work poses from the point of view of contacts between the nascent Arab civilisation and the ancient cultures of Iran and the classical world 7. This work—it is for us a duty and a pleasure to emphasise here—was made possible by the kindness of the Directors of the principal libraries of Europe and Istanbul, who made available to us the reproductions of manuscripts indispensable to such research. In particular, we have contracted a heavy debt of gratitude to the direction of the Vatican Library, from which we requested not only photographs of its manuscripts, but also microfilms of books we wished to consult. Likewise, we must thank here our friend, Professor Muhammad Hamidullah, who was kind enough to carry out, on our behalf, research in the numerous treatises that we had been unable to find in the libraries of Italy. I The work that we propose to study in this article has been preserved for us—we have just said—by two manuscripts. The first, of Syro-Egyptian origin 1, was completed on 11 Ḏū-l-Ḥiǧǧa 714 h. and constituted as a \"waqf\" at the Aya Sofya Library by the \"Sultan bn-as-sulṭān Maḥmūd\", as declared by a note on the first folio, by the \"Sultan Maḥmūd bnu-Muṣṭafā\"; according to the \"tuġra\" of the seal, that is to say Sultan Maḥmūd I. The second manuscript, written in",
    "7": "716 h. which we know only through a microfilm made available to us by the Direction of the Süleymaniye Library with its customary generosity, had been constituted as a « waqf » at the Library of the Fatih Mosque by the same Mahmud. No indication of the place of origin is found there, but according to a note on the recto of the first folio, it had belonged to the Library of Bayazit II. The Aya Sofya and Fatih mss both contain the same works: a selection of « conversations and correspondence between Alexander and his master Aristotle », in total sixteen pieces sometimes preceded by a short introduction, and a collection of narratives of different origins, always relating to Aristotle and Alexander. On f. 122v of the Aya Sofya ms. and on f. 109v of the Fatih ms., that is to say at the end of the last piece of the « Conversations and correspondence », three almost identical notes can be read, so that one would be tempted to consider the Fatih ms. as a copy of the Aya Sofya one: t, 11t. .~)yP 01t. t, ~ 01t. :U~I ~I ~ 0ls\" (,) L?')1 ~ ;;)~ I r)\\.c ~ I .u; L.)

In the copy from which the present one was transcribed, there were notes, of which here is the reproduction 2:\n\n1. \"This is what I found of the conversations [of Aristotle] put in writing and of his letters, a famous text (?) by the hand of the scribe of Niffar, Muragga-bn-al Mu'ammal. He declared having collated this work with several manuscripts and having corrected it. He said:\n\n\"The reader should not hasten to doubt what he reads. In what I have copied, there is an exact meaning that reflection will clarify. When I found in [my] copy errors and negligences, I corrected them, as far as my intelligence and capabilities permitted. I likewise corrected the faults that I considered as 'lapsus calami.' If faults of this kind appear to the reader—which no one manages to avoid completely—it is his duty to correct them and remove them.\"\n\n'Ali-bn-Muḥammadi-bn-Aḥmadi-bn-al Qadi-l-Hamagani, the scribe of Miyafaraqin, wrote it giving thanks to God for the favor of His generosity toward him. And he completed his copy on the first Wednesday of the month of muḥarram of the year 471 h.\n\nPraise belongs to God lord of the world, reward to the pious, hatred only to the oppressors [f. 123v]. And may the prayer of God be upon the noblest of His creatures, the seal of His prophets, our lord Muḥammad, upon his family and upon His holy house.\n\nII. Then 3 when I had already finished copying the letters, another book fell into my hands, where there was a letter from Alexander to his mother to console her; teachings and philosophical maxims of Aristotle; exhor-",
    "9": "tations and instructions. Therefore I deemed it appropriate to add them to his letters» 4 5. III. Marginal note at f. 123r of ms. Aya Sofya.\n\nThis copy was collated and corrected according to the original and what was found doubtful therein was corrected according to another copy. The reader should not hasten to doubt what he reads.\n\nThe absence or near-absence of variants, the fact that the marginal note of ms. Aya Sofya is found in the text of ms. Fati.Q. where it is inserted between notes I and II, would seem to establish the dependence of ms. Fati.Q. on that of Aya Sofya. However, in examining the marginal corrections to the texts of the «as-Siyāsat-al-'āmmiya», of the «letter of Alexander to his mother» and of the «Ḫabar-ibtidā'ī ta'līmī Arisṭāṭālīsā» in both mss, corrections which are all in the hand of our copyists, we have noted anomalies. For example, in eight cases, ms. Fati.Q. has, in its text, the same readings and, in the margins, the same variants as ms. Aya Sofya. It would already be difficult to admit that a scribe as careful as that of ms. Fati.Q. copied the erroneous readings of ms. Aya Sofya without first noticing the quite legible corrections in the margins. But there is more: in three passages, one of which is in the «Ḫabar ibtidā'ī ta'līmī Arisṭāṭālīsā» — ms. Aya Sofya indicates, in the margin,",
    "10": "better variants, which, in ms. Fatiḥ, are found in the text. Nevertheless, in these three cases, the scribe of the latter manuscript subsequently restored in the margins the readings considered erroneous in ms. Aya Sofya!\n\nThese facts, apparently contradictory, can have, it seems to us, only one explanation. Ms. Fatiḥ 5323 is not a copy of ms. Aya Sofya 4260. Both rather derive, through several intermediaries, from a common archetype, that of the scribe 'Ali-bnu Muhammad of Mayafaraqin, and they were corrected with the help of different copies of this same archetype. It is only in this manner that one can understand the choice of opposing readings by the two copyists at the moment of revision of their own work.\n\nWe have dwelt on the relationships between these two manuscripts with a view to interpreting the notes that are found almost identical in the two volumes. Indeed, after having established the independence of ms. Fatiḥ from that of the Aya Sofya, it also follows that notes I and II cannot belong to the copyists of our mss., but must go back to the scribe of the archetype 'Ali-bnu-Muhammad al-Fariqi 6. But then, the interpretation of the notes found in our mss. is no longer ambiguous: it was 'Ali-bnu-Muhammad who added to the collection of pseudo-Aristotelian letters the accounts about Aristotle and Alexander that appear in both volumes and thus belong to an anthology from the beginning of the 5th century of the Hegira 7. On the other hand, the selection of these letters was not the work of 'Ali-bnu-Muhammad any more than of Muragga-bnu-l-Mu'ammal. Indeed, Muragga possessed several copies of this selection, which therefore goes back to an even earlier period.\n\nOf the sixteen pieces of correspondence between Alexander and Aristotle preserved in our mss., three—let us note in passing—were already known. The \"counsels of Aristotle\" are found in the \"al-Hik-\n\n6 One will likewise attribute to 'Ali-bnu Muhammad the notes to chapters V and VI of the second part. On the other hand, note III and that of the last fol. of ms. Aya Sofya undoubtedly belong to a reader who had once again collated the text of 'Ali-bnu Muhammad with the copy of Muragga-bnu-Mu'ammal. As for the corrections that appear in the margins of ms. Aya Sofya, they can hardly go back to this first revision. In our view, they are rather the work of the copyist who, evidently, corrected his own work with the help of another ms. always deriving from that of 'Ali-bnu Muhammad.\n\n7 It contains a «risala» of Muhammad al Hasan al Ḥatimi who died in 998 (see BROCKELMANN, GAL, I, 88).",
    "11": "mat-al halida »; they were published by Cheikho based on ms. Vatican arabe n. 408 and recently by M. Badawi in his critical edition of Miskawayh's work. The « Epistle on Ethics », preserved in ms. Paris B.N., ar. chret. 132, where it bears the title « maqala fī-l-tadbīr », was likewise published by Cheikho 8, who also gave a second edition of Aristotle's letter to Alexander preserved in folios attached to ms. Vatican arabe 408, which Lippert had already edited and translated under the title of περὶ βασιλείας. But ms. Vatican arabe 408 contains a text much shorter than that of mss Aya Sofya and Fātiḥ. In all likelihood, it is a summary due to some copyist who knew only Aristotle's response. Indeed, the latter circulated independently from an early date, as it is found, in its complete form, with the « Epistle on Ethics » in two mss of the Aya Sofya Library, ms. 2890 from 541 h. 9 and ms. 2884 much more recent.\n\nAll these mss preserving separate pieces of our work are of interest only for a critical edition of the texts. By contrast, two other mss shed new light on the history of this collection of ps. Aristotelian letters. Thus, ms. Köprülü 1608, a copy from the end of the 16th century, or even the beginning of the 17th century, of an ancient anthology—which contained no piece later than the 11th century—has preserved for us the entire « as-Siyāsat-al-'āmmiya »; the correspondence concerning the Persian nobles taken prisoner; Alexander's letter asking Aristotle for a treatise on government and the philosopher's response, entitled here « On the manner of",
    "12": "governing cities » 10. And this title deserves all our attention, because it probably derives from the Greek original. But, above all, this ms. has preserved for us the abridgement of the 1TEpt KoufLoV which originally appeared in our « correspondence between Alexander and Aristotle» robts\n\nEqually interesting is ms. Paris RN. 2422, although it contains only the « as-Siyasat-al-'ammiya »). It is a ms. from the beginning of the 7th century of the Hegira which, towards the middle, presents a large lacuna; but it does not derive from the selection of letters found in the mss Aya Sofya and Fatiḥ.11. Thus it has preserved for us variants going back in part to the original work. We learn for example that the author of our work wrote « Flatun» and « Fur» instead of « Iflatun» and « Fuz »; « Iksandar» instead of « Iskandar »), an archaic form not found, to our knowledge, in any other Arabic text 12. Moreover, he indicated Aristotle's treatise on morals by its original title « Ethique a Nicomaque »), a title no longer appearing in the mss Aya Sofya and Fatil;t, which substituted that of the Arabic version « Kitab-al-alJ.laq» 13. Finally, the Paris ms. has preserved for us the last lines of the « as-Siyasat-al-'ammiya »), in which Aristotle declares having responded to a request from Alexander.\n\nHence the importance of this ms. for the history of ps.-Aristo-\n\nJ' .. 1l1.lki\n\n10 ·..l11 :t..L.. .

We had the impression that the author of this anthology did not possess a complete copy of the « rasa:il », but knew them through other even older anthologies. The ms. Koprulu abounds in errors, but it has sometimes preserved better readings for us. Moreover, it agrees quite often with the variants found in the letters from Alexander to Dara (Darius), to the Arabs and to Fauz (Porus) belonging to the « as-Siyasat-al 'ammiya» and which were reproduced in the « Kitab-es.siydaa fi tadbiri-r-ri'asa » from the beginning of the 5th century of the Hegira. Of these letters, Nawali has given us the Arabic text and the Turkish version. It thus remains proven that these variants go back to a copy of the « rasa'il » at least as old as that of our « Selected Pieces ».\n\n12 On the other hand, this ms. already presents the alteration of the name Kuros to Ka'us (f. 14v). In the other mss one finds alternately the forms uZ.J lS and uZ) lS (Aya Sofya fol. 29v and 48v; Fatil,J. fol. 26v and 42r) and l.Y'.J.) and l.Y'.JD (ms.

    "15": "of the «Selected Pieces» from this «Correspondence». Now, a work of this kind is mentioned by Ibn-al-Nadim, who, in his «Fihrist», declares: «Salim, surnamed Abu-l-'Ala', secretary of Hisam ibn 'Abdi-l-Malik. He was allied to 'Abd-ul-Hamid. He was a very eloquent and accomplished writer. He translated the letters of Aristotle to Alexander. They were translated for him and he put them in order. His collection of letters comprises about one hundred folios» 17.\n\nOf course, we do not hide from ourselves that the simple comparison between this paragraph of the «Fihrist» and the indications of our two mss would not suffice to attribute the authorship of these «rasa'il» to Salim Abu-l-'Ala'. However, a meticulous examination of piece VIII, the «as-Siyasat al'ammiya» has allowed us to collect a long series of passages that confirm this attribution. It will suffice here to indicate the most conclusive ones that we have examined and published in our article on this work from the point of view of Umayyad civilization. The Arab author, for example, openly displays his contempt for freedmen and for slaves; when he happens to speak of the high personages upon whom the life of the Caliph depended, he hardly mentions the vizirate. The Arab army that he describes had an aristocratic character, the «ṣufūf» constituted its battle formation, the «karādīsa» being mentioned only as tactical units of the Turkish cavalry, and combats still began with duels between «champions». The enemy that this author feared the most were the Turks. As for the Khorassanians, they appear in this «siyāsa» as a warlike people, whose goodwill it was important for the caliph to win. Nowhere are we told that this population was devoted to the cause of the dynasty, as was the case in the Abbasid period. Finally, the author of this «siyāsa» must have occupied an elevated position at the court of his sovereign and we know from Ṭabarī, from Al-Kindī and from al-Mas'ūdī that in fact Salim Abū-l-'Alā' enjoyed the full confidence of Hišām b. 'Abdi-l-Malik.\n\nEach piece, we were saying, is framed by an introduction and Mr. Stern has already published the one that precedes the «De Mundo».

    "17": "assistance in the study of piece XVI. From now on we can approach the central theme of this article, namely the demonstration that pieces I-X, XIII, XV and XVI of our \"selected passages\" all belong to a single Greek epistolary novel.\n\nRegarding passages III, V, VIII, IX, X and XIII, which represent two-thirds of the collection, this proof is provided to us by the ps.-Homeric sentences found therein. Professor Corbatto, of the University of Trieste, who was kind enough to examine them, pointed out to us how, in two or three cases, one seems to perceive a distant echo of the text of the Iliad and the Odyssey.\n\nThese sentences, which the Arab translator considered as verses because they came from the \"poet Homer,\" recall rather the JL€TaeppaaH> of the Iliad and the Odyssey. In the last centuries of Hellenism, as is known, the imitation of these poems, which previously had been merely a simple exercise in schools of rhetoric, had attained the dignity of an independent literary genre and had given rise to the /-L€Ta{3oAa{ of Demosthenes the Thracian 22, to the /-L€Ta1TOt-rJa€t> of Sopatros 23 and to the /-L€TaeppaaH> of Procopius of Gaza 24, a rhetorician to whom the spectacle of the \"gravity of camels,\" noted in our sentence 11, must have been familiar. The almost total loss of these works prevents any attempt to identify the source of our sentences, and moreover they may well be the work of the epistolographer himself. On the other hand, they could in no way have been interpolated by Salim Abu-l-'Ala'.\n\nTherefore we provide in the appendix the text and translation of the twenty ps.-Homeric quotations found in our two manuscripts, because we consider them the most conclusive proof that the pieces where they appear, and in particular the \"as-Siyasatal-'ammiya,\" go back to a Greek original and were part of the same work. At this point, it will not be superfluous to note that in our \"selected passages\" we also find a verse from Hesiod that corresponds almost exactly to the Greek text 25, an unknown verse",
    "18": "of Euripides 26 and finally a verse of Pindar, in which Professor Corbatto recognised the translation of fragment 169 Snell 27.\n\nAs for pieces I, II, VI and VII, where these pseudo-Homeric quotations are not encountered, we have other proofs of their classical origin and their belonging to our \"Epistolary Romance\". Moreover, the absence of these supposed verses could be caused by the technique of Salim Abu-l-'Alā' who had the habit of citing long parts of the original almost \"in extenso\", while omitting others 28. Consequently, he risked removing passages containing verses, which indeed happened to him in the abridgement of the Περὶ Κόσμου, where the two last chapters, precisely those containing passages from the Odyssey, are omitted.\n\nAs for pieces I, II, VI and VII, where these pseudo-Homeric quotations are not encountered, we have other proofs of their classical origin and their belonging to our \"Epistolary Romance\".

Consequently, he risked removing passages containing verses, which indeed happened to him in the abridgement of the Περὶ Κόσμου, where the two last chapters, precisely those containing passages from the Odyssey, are omitted.\n\nRegarding the first letter of Aristotle to Philip and the King's response (pieces I and II), it is hardly necessary to provide proof to establish that they belong to the \"Epistolary Romance\", for a pseudo-Homeric quotation appears, as we have said, in the second letter addressed to Philip (piece III), and these missives constitute a whole. Let us add that, in piece I, we read that Alexander was to acquire the wisdom of Anasīn, Furflus and Alfasaris. Now, it is clear that the Arab author had found these names in the original, for he manifestly knew nothing of these personages 29. Moreover, in this letter, one encounters a τόπος going back to Prodicus: if Heracles had sought only pleasure and love, he would never have executed the twelve labours that made him famous.\n\nEqually probative passages are found in the other letters.

    "19": "conquer the people of this region, an event that Arab historiographers, as far as we know, have always ignored 30. Likewise, one could not imagine an Arab writer composing the « Letter from Aristotle to Alexander to congratulate him on the conquest of Anfisan » (piece VII). Indeed, only a classical author could know or imagine that the Greeks had suspected Alexander of wanting to impose his domination under the pretext of fighting the Persians, as some of their « princes » had done in the past. Evidence of this kind is unfortunately lacking for pieces IV, XV and XVI. This is not because, in our opinion, their Hellenistic origin is in doubt. Piece IV, probably partly reworked by Salim, places such vigorous emphasis on the necessity of παιδεία, that it would be difficult to attribute it to an Arab writer of the first centuries of the Hijra. Moreover, it is similar in its arguments to piece V and it is so closely connected by the introduction to the other letters that one cannot doubt its belonging to the epistolary novel.

The victory that you won over them contains a lesson for you. Indeed the Scythians are valiant warriors. Dara had undertaken an expedition against them at the head of all of Asia. -Yet Scythia is today more prosperous and more populated than it was at that time. -He wanted to destroy them, but he could not carry out his design. He did not manage to encircle them, as you have done. We have not heard that any king of times past conquered their country. They, on the other hand, seized all the countries of Asia, certain countries of Europe, Thrace, and still more other countries belonging to the Rum, and they penetrated into the interior of their Empire ·. One cannot escape the impression that the Scythians of the Greek epistolographer, who were more powerful than those of the time of Darius I, were none other than the Huns. This would explain why he attributed to them on the one hand the conquest of Thrace and incursions into the interior of the Roman Empire, and on the other the devastation of all of Asia. One should no doubt think of the raids of the Houyouna in Syria, which the chronicle of Joshua the Stylite tells us about, and the incursions of the Sabirs into Iran and into the Byzantine Empire.",
    "20": "For its part, piece XV, a letter of intercession in favour of a certain Ar};l.sadis ('Apgci8'1']d), contains allusions to interventions by other persons in favour of this protégé of Aristotle. Assuredly, it was not invented by Salīm who, like us, knew nothing of this Ar};l.sadis. However, nothing proves that it was part of our epistolary novel. At most, one could say that it is hardly probable that such an obscure letter would have been translated into Arabic if it were not found in a collection of ps.-Aristotelian epistles. And we have no reason to believe that the Arabs possessed other novels of this kind. There is no need, moreover, to dwell further on this piece whose importance within our work is negligible. By contrast, piece XVI is of exceptional interest for the history of the \"Epistolary Novel\" and its influence on Arabic literature. Thus the problem of knowing whether it has a classical origin and, even more, whether it is part of it, requires particular attention.\n\nA simple reading of this piece, of which we provide the translation in the appendix, suffices to establish several facts, namely: that we possess only a selection of the sentences pronounced by the philosophers on the occasion of Alexander's burial 31; that these sentences, in the « rasā'il », followed a letter from Alexander to Olympias and that this letter, judging by the two passages cited in the introduction 32, was the same one found in the \"Apophthegms\"\n\n31 One will note how, in our mss, sentences XII, XIII and XIV were added from another copy of the \"selected pieces\". They are introduced by the observation \"other sentences also pronounced on Alexander\" and, moreover, sentences VIII and XII are only variants of sentences IV and IX.\n\nT ~\n\n32 Aya Sofya, fol. 121v: ~ ~ I :i.W I J ~ ':11 J::>:-I W J ~. t cr 41 if~IJ ~ ~\\ ,~.:lJJ\\J J1 ~ ~ cr ,y J~':11 ~\\r ..uJ ..:.Jlj ~I ~~ yl;:S(l\\ J.,.:-J WJ .~ ;(.i...)UJ I d lj ~ ·(j\"l:.J Iou) ~ ~ W J ~ \"When Alexander contracted the illness that made him despair of life, he wrote to his mother: Prepare a meal and invite those whom no misfortune has struck.\n\nWhen the letter containing this invitation arrived to his mother, she exclaimed: Alexander wished to console me for his own death.\"\n\nAt his death men mourned him.

    "21": "attributed to Hunayn 33. Now, it has long been observed that the letter from these « Apophthegmata », in which Alexander orders Olympias not to admit persons struck by misfortune to his funeral banquet, resembles that of version A of ps.-Callisthenes and of ms. Vulcan. 93 of Leiden 34.\n\nLet us add further that the sentences preserved in our « selected passages » present a truly remarkable characteristic. Arabic literature contains, as is well known, a great number of collections of sentences pronounced at Alexander's funeral, the richest of which are those of Hunayn and of ms. Köprülü 1608. However, none of the collections we have been able to examine contains all thirteen sentences of our « selected passages », and all, on the contrary, cite a certain number of them, as demonstrated by the table given in our appendix.\n\nIt is thus established that the piece from the « rasā'il », of which passage XVI has preserved only a selection for us, constituted the archetype of all collections of this kind found in Islamic literature. And this piece, let us add immediately, derived from a Greek text. In our view, two facts establish this. In our Arabic texts, we still read the names of some of the authors of these apophthegms. Now, among these names, there are some that Muslim authors could hardly have invented. For example Milatus and Filihun in the mss Aya Sofya and Fatih; Dorotheus in Tha'ālibī; Narun, Ṭiyāvun, Dimitr, Matrun, Sisan, Filqatun in Eutychius; Matrun, Bartus, Mirawis and Maymus in the « Iskandarnamah » of Ahmedi 35. It is true that, among the other names cited by Ahmedi, Aristotle is the only contemporary of Alexander. Equally startling anachronisms recur in the other collections. In another letter, which we believe belongs to our epistolographer, Alexander speaks of a",
    "22": "Rufus who lived in the 1st century of our era 36 and who, in the « Iskandarnamah » of Ahmedi, participates in his funeral 37. One can see how wrong it would be to deny the Hellenistic origin of these sentences on account of these anachronisms, or even to hold the Arab writers alone responsible for them.\n\nBut there is an even stronger reason to admit the classical origin of our sentences. They betray an evident animosity towards Alexander, and, according to the collections of Mas'ūdī and Eutychius, Roxane would have protested against the words of the philosophers 38. Such vehement condemnations of the person of Alexander could not have been invented by Muslims, for whom « Ḏū l-qarnayn » was the hero to whom God had spoken. They can only go back to Stoic writers.\n\nIf therefore the Hellenistic origin of the letter of Alexander to Olympias f L...U\n\nIf therefore the Hellenistic origin of the letter of Alexander to Olympias f L...U\n\n36 Ms. Vatican Syriac 209, fol. 1v: ~~ d~ ~ l;1;.. ~ .. ;.:'1 ~,)JI ~ \\:;-. ~. 1;11 · I.L._ I -1\\ .<\"\"'1 ~ ~ .J. ~ ~ ~ ~.JJ ~ \":? e,S..f:\"'-' · '\" ~ I .J u:u I.J '\" ~ I :i:w. ~ ~ ~ ~ « When we submitted them to refining according to the Great Way invented by the philosopher Rufus to purify gold and silver, their entire body came out very pure, very malleable and very luminous ...\n\n~.JJ ..I.:~ 0~ .J'!\n\n.>.:;1 f 0L. ~0~\n\ne,S..Lli« Rufus exclaimed: O King, born under a propitious conjunction of the stars // Yesterday the world belonged to you from one end to the other, // To you, whom this day has cast into this pitiful condition. // Who has overturned your banner in this manner? » [ms. Orient 90, fol. 297r, Biblioteca Marciana, Venice].\n\n38 Let us note that this protestation of Roxane was interpolated by Eutychius. It is found neither in ms. Köprülü 1608 nor in the « History of the Death of Alexander », by an anonymous author, which served as the source for the « Life of Alexander », on which the Chronicle of Eutychius and the passage from ms. Köprülü 1608 depend. Mas'ūdī, on the other hand, attributes to Roxane exactly the same words as Eutychius. It seems that Arab writers possessed several collections of apophthegms of philosophers on the burial of Alexander and that they selected sentences according to their personal taste. There is no doubt that they modified them freely and even created new ones. It is doubtless in this way that the presence of different apophthegms is explained, even in works having a common source such as the « History of the Death of Alexander », the passage from ms. Köprülü and the Chronicle of Eutychius, or the « Apophthegms » of Ḥunayn and the « Aḫbār al-Iskandar » of al-Mubaššir.",
    "23": "and the apophthegms pronounced by the philosophers on the occasion of the burial of the Macedonian hero is beyond doubt, however their belonging to our \"Epistolary Romance\" seems to encounter two difficulties.\n\nThe Greek letter analogous to that of the « rasā'il » is found in the \"Biography of Alexander\" and, therefore, it would be logical to suppose that it belonged rather to ps.-Callisthenes, which is moreover the thesis of M. Spitaler 39. Furthermore, the Greek epistolographer exalted throughout his letters the figure of Alexander and it would be difficult to understand that he would have pronounced at the end a condemnation of his policy and his historical role.\n\nHowever it happened that our epistolographer - as we shall see hereafter - employed older sources, without realizing that they did not fit with his own ideas. Thus we can disregard this contradiction to concentrate on the problem of the origin of the letter cited in the « rasā'il ».\n\nThe limits of this article oblige us to summarize the results of our research on this point. In a study written when the principal Arabic versions of this letter were unpublished, M. Walzer considered that it belonged to a Hellenistic treatise, probably by Themistius, incorporated in the « Risālat-al-Kindī fī-l-ḥīla li-dafʿ-i-l-aḥzān » 40. For his part, M. Spitaler, to whom we owe a classification of the letters read in the \"Apophthegms\" attributed to Ḥunayn, in the ms. Köprülü 1608, in Eutychius, al-Kindī and al-Masʿūdī, connected them to the Arabic version of ps.-Callisthenes 41. In the present state of our knowledge, he judged, it would be impossible to reconstruct the history of these three versions 42. In fact, one finds in Arabic literature still other specimens of this missive.",
    "24": "Thus, in the «Bocados d'oro» 43, the Spanish translation of the «Muhtar-al hikam», we read Alexander's complete letter to Olympias, of which al-Mubassir Ibn Fatik had given in the original only the «incipit», because he had already transcribed it in his «Tarih Kabir». Evidently a copyist of the «Muhtar-al-ḥikam» had taken care to fill this gap and, by a fortunate coincidence, his volume came into the hands of the Spanish translator. The fact that, in the Spanish version, we find the «incipit» indicated by al-Mubassir and, above all, the concordance between the Spanish text of the letter and the scene of the funeral banquet in the «Ahbar-al-Iskandar» definitively confirm that the «Bocados d'Oro» have preserved for us the letter from the «Tarih Kabir». Now, this letter is almost identical to letter no. I in Ḥunayn with one difference. Just as the fragment preserved by Mas'ūdī, it ignores the advice given by Alexander to his mother to build a city in order to celebrate his funeral banquet there. Just as in the Greek letter of ms. Vulcan. 93, the King asks his mother only to prepare a splendid feast 44. It is likewise the celebration of a banquet and not the construction of a city that is discussed in the letter preserved in the Ethiopic version of the «Histoire de la mort d'Alexandre» 45. The author of this history followed the account of ps.-Callisthenes on the poisoning of the Macedonian hero; but he did not thereby renounce enhancing his narration with the text of a letter from Alexander to Olympias resembling that of the «Tarih-Kabir» and with the description of the funeral banquet. Now, this version was taken up by Abu Sakar, Al-Makin and by the author of a «Vie d'Alexandre», now lost, fragments of which are found in the Chronicle of Eu-",
    "25": "tychius, the anthology preserved in ms. Koprulu 1608 and in the \"Ethiopian Romance of Alexander\". The latter has preserved for us the passage from this \"Life\" in which the king proclaimed that, in order to better express his new policy, he had adopted in his letters the formula \"From Alexander, servant of God\" 46. This is the very heading found in epistle II ) J..:S:.. 'Y I .uJ I ..y. Cr' which otherwise does not appear in the Arabic \"Romances\". And this epistle II is only a clumsy summary of the letter incorporated in the \"History of the Death of Alexander\", a summary that omits the king's advice to his mother to organize a funeral banquet and which obliged the author of this \"Life\" to renounce the banquet scene itself.\n\nAs for version III of the \"Letter of Alexander\", undoubtedly the work of an author proposing to demonstrate his ability to compose variations on the theme of the vanity of earthly life, with which version I begins, there exist two more specimens in addition to the one published by M. Spitaler 47. The most important has been preserved for us by the anthology appended to our \"rasa'il\" in the mss. Aya Sofya and Fatil}. According to the indications of the author of this anthology, it was found in a work of Mada'in, who had heard it recited at the court of AI-Ma'mūn by his secretary 'Amrubnu-Mas'ada. In fact, it is a composition still preserving certain passages from Letter I that no longer appear in other texts of this class 48: the second letter of the Apophthegms of",
    "26": "Hunayn and the one read in the «Ethiopian Romance of Alexander» 49. Let us add finally that the poet Abū-l-ʿAtāhiya (end of the 2nd century of the Hegira) already knew the sentences pronounced by the philosophers on the occasion of Alexander's burial 50.\n\nFrom what we have just said, a first fact emerges with certainty. Alexander's letter to Olympias and the sentences pronounced during the Macedonian king's funeral were known in the Arab world well before the time of al-Kindī and Ḥunayn. Furthermore, if one closely examines the different specimens of «Letter I», to which must be added the fragment included in the «Conforto delle tristezze» by Elya al-Ǧawharī 51, one will not be long in perceiving that despite the variants, they all proceed from a single translation of the Greek original, an original that was closely related to that of ms. Vulcan. 93. Thus, for example, the fragments of al-Kindī, al-Ǧawharī and al-Masʿūdī agree among themselves and with ms.

    "27": "celebrated in a joyful atmosphere, a detail omitted in the « Bocados d'Oro », Hunayn I and the « Histoire de la mort d' Alexandre» 52. Only al-Kindi and al-Gawhari have preserved for us the last words of Olympias which once again have their exact counterpart in ms. Vulcan. 93 53. On the other hand, it is in al-Gawhari and al-Mas'ūdī that we find the equivalent of another phrase from the Greek letter 54. A few lines further, al-Kindi again approaches al-Mas'ūdī, while al-Gawhari and Hunayn I present a manifestly erroneous reading 55. Finally, we find in al-Mas'ūdī an isolated variant, which however is confirmed by the « rasā'il» 56.\n\nUp to this point we have asked the letter of ms. Vulcan.93 to provide a criterion for choosing among the different readings of the Arabic texts. The latter, taken as a whole, in turn allow us to reach some conclusions about the original form of the Greek letter. Three of our missives (Bocados, Hunayn I, al-Kindi) specify that Olympias was to convoke the people of Libya, Europe, Asia and Macedonia, a detail not found in the ms.",
    "28": "Vulcan. 93. We have also observed that this letter opened with remarks on the necessity of enduring pain with dignity and on the necessity of death, of which the advice about the banquet was only the conclusion, whereas ms.

I OE<:,afJ-EVTJ fJ-OV TaVTTJV T7JV TEI\\EVTaLav ypa'fJTJv ···\n\nFinally, the account of the funeral banquet is, from an artistic point of view, much better arranged in Arabic, even if it adds nothing to the dry narration of the Greek text. Therefore, one can formulate a first conclusion: mss. Vulcan. 93 and Bodleianus Baroccus 23 have preserved for us only a summary of the original letter, which was interpolated into the \"Biography\" at a relatively recent period. At the beginning, it did not belong to the cycle of ps.-Callisthenes.\n\n»\n\nIn this regard, it is not without interest to note how the \"incipit\" of the letters in the \"Bocados d'Oro\" and in ms. Aya Sofya 57 corresponds quite well to that of the \"Testament of Alexander\" in the Syriac version 58. We even believe we can discern an affinity between\n\n....\n\n57 ... 1 'I I ... r ' ~ .)\\.,Jj o~ .,;, ~ I I ... r ' ~ ..\\.:.5:.. :J I . t-' u-~;-') J\" ..

It helps to understand the formation of the name \"Rūfiya\", \"Ruqiya\" found in most Arabic texts. The confusion between \"r\" and \"l\" reveals its Pahlavi origin. This should not be too surprising, for the name Rusanak derives in turn from a Persian source and not from the Syriac translation of the \"Biography\", where it is spelled \"Rusanaq\", a form preserved by the \"Ethiopian Romance\" and to which the form \"Rustaq\" (recte Rusanaq) of Ḥunayn must be connected. The Syriac translation of the \"Biography\" – it must not be forgotten – was only one of the channels through which the Islamic world came to know the legend of the Macedonian hero (see in particular Israel FRIEDLANDER, Alexanders Zug nach dem Lebensquell, in Archiv für Religionswissenschaft, 13, 1910). The few other names cited by Al-Mubassir that do not derive from the Syriac translation must doubtless be explained by the influence of these different sources (see MESSNER, l.c., p. 623).\n\n58 Trad. Budge: « From Alexander to Ammon and to my mother Olympias greeting.

Do thou then, my mother, not be grieved nor distressed at my departure, for such is the will of God, but console thyself in thy wisdom and be glad I).",
    "29": "the beginning of the epistle from the ms. Aya Sofya and the first lines of this «Testament». At the very least, the «incipit» of letter III Aya Sofya, on the one hand contains the idea expressly affirmed in the «Testament» of the Syriac version that Alexander was about to leave the world of the living to enter the world of spirits; on the other hand, it gives Olympias the appellations ~)I 01(the dear one, the friend), corresponding to the adjective yAvKVTa:T7J of ms. Vulcan. 93. It remains for us to investigate by what route this letter arrived in the «Arab Romance of Alexander», for even if one cannot exclude the possibility that the Arabs knew extracts from redaction A, nothing indicates such knowledge 59. Now, the letters of the «Bocados d'Oro» and the «Murūǧ aḏ-ḏahab» appear in narratives that explain Alexander's death by illness. Ḥunayn, it is true, mentions the poison that Alexander was allegedly given to drink. But, upon careful examination of his «Apophthegms», one realizes that in the original, it was a question of illness and that the words inserted in the title of this chapter «he had drunk a poison» are only a gloss 60. Indeed, this account by Ḥunayn is placed in the same context as that of al-Mubassir. Both believed they knew that Alexander had died after a visit to the city of the Gymnosophists. The only difference is that Ḥunayn gives a version of this visit that differs slightly from that of al-Mubassir 61. Therefore, only the anonymous author of the «History of the Death of Alexander» connects this letter to the episode of the poisoning. However, the anomalies in his letter sufficiently prove that it is a secondary text that has been largely reworked. Our letter belonged—one can no longer doubt it—to the version that has Alexander die of illness, a version foreign to the «Biography», whose different forms agreed on three points: having perceived the signs announced by a prophecy, Alex-",
    "30": "ander realises that he will no longer recover; he then writes a final letter to Olympias; after his death, the philosophers gather around his coffin. Now, the last two points are found in piece XVI of the « Roman epistolaire », Only the first is missing there, but one should not be too surprised, since the introduction that, in the « rasa'il », was supposed to link this piece to the others, was probably summarised by the author of our « morceaux choisis» 63. Moreover, the theme of prophecy recurs regularly in the pieces of our Roman epistolaire. This suffices to say that, in its essential features, the same version of the death of the Macedonian king appears both in the « rasa'il » and in the Arabic « Biography» of Alexander. But then, to which of these two works did this version originally belong? Only one answer is possible to this question in the present state of our knowledge. It must have appeared in our « Roman epistolaire », for it is only by this hypothesis that one can explain two facts at once: the interpolation of an abridgement of this same letter in a recent Greek redaction of ps.-Callisthenes and the appearance, within the Arabic « Biography», of a version of Alexander's death foreign to the Greek « Biography», but of Hellenistic origin, as the « Apophtegmes des philosophes» prove. One will accept this all the more easily given that, in the « Aḫbar-al-Iskandar» of al-Mubassir, we find again the episode of the illness and natural death of Philip, an episode taken literally- 62 According to this version, Alexander would have fallen ill at Qumis during the return journey to Babylon and would have died at Sahrzur in Kurdistan. Before dying, he would have had a letter written to his mother in order to console her. A sign had announced to him his imminent death; struck down by fever, he had dismounted and had lain on a shield of iron in the shade of a golden shield. Coming to his senses, he remembered how, according to a prophecy, his death would have taken place under a golden sky and on an iron earth. According to Eutychius and al-Mubassir, this sign would have been foreseen by the astrologers. Eutychius even specifies that the astrologers had seen it at the moment of his birth and had informed Olympias. Ta'ālibi attributes the omen to Ptolemy Lagos, the « Kitab Isṭamāḫis » cited in « Picatrix » (II, book III, chap. VI) to Aristotle who would have informed Alexander by letter. Even in the « Roman ethiopien », p. 293, signs, which the translator unfortunately does not specify, announce to Alexander that his death is imminent. Only Mas'ūdī does not speak of it, while accepting, in his «Murūǧ », the same version of the letter to Olympias. Finally, all these authors know that the philosophers of Alexander's retinue pronounced maxims at his burial. 63 We do indeed say the author of our «morceaux choisis», since it is evident that the latter brought together under a single heading two pieces originally distinct: Alexander's letter to Olympias and the maxims pronounced during the burial of the hero.",
    "31": "ment of the introduction which, in the « rasa'il », precedes piece VI 64. Henceforth a conclusion imposes itself. Our « selected extracts » have preserved for us, not an Islamic collection of ps.-Aristotelian letters, but a true Hellenistic epistolary novel, not without analogy with that which, according to M. Merkelbach's research, constituted the basis of the « Biography » of ps.-Callisthenes. In this way, they provide an indirect, but no less valuable, confirmation of the German scholar's theses. However, they have preserved for us only a part of this « Novel »,\n\nThree letters from Alexander seem to have been omitted: precisely the three missives, to which Aristotle alludes in his responses and which announced to him the conquest of Scythia and of « Anfisan » and the expedition to the end of the world. But other cuts still must have been made by the author of our selection and these may have profoundly altered the character of the original. Indeed a phrase from the « as-Siyasat-al'ammiya » allows us to glimpse how the novel of the Greek epistolographer also contained magical teachings. At f. 74v of the ms, Aya Sofya, we read: « When you descend into a place infested with vipers, employ what I have described to you and they will flee 65 » ·\n\nIt is impossible not to understand these words as an allusion to the well-known episode of vipers attacking Alexander's soldiers in the « De mirabilibus Indie ». Therefore, what Aristotle described to",
    "32": "Alexander can only be a talisman. Moreover, we are told about it again in the « Sirr-al-asrar » 66. Finally, let us recall that, in another epistle to Alexander, the « Kitab-al-Istamayis », Aristotle alludes to the amulet « al-Amatis » designed to protect the King from snow and rain, which brings us back once more to the « De Mirabilibus Indie ». Certainly, the « Kitab-al-Istamayis », partially preserved in ms. Oxford Marsh 556, does not belong to our Hellenistic Romance. Of this work, we know only the citations of ps. al-Magrit! in his « Picatrix », but they suffice to prove that its author was already inspired by our letter XI 67. Consequently, it is an Islamic magical treatise. Nevertheless, taking into account the passage from the « aa-Siyaeat-al-tammiya » that we have just cited, one must indeed consider the hypothesis that, just as was the case for the « Sirr-al-asrar », the « Kitab-al-Istamfthlar is actually derived from a letter of our epistolary romance through more or less profound reworkings. Above all, what cannot be doubted is that our romance already contained pages in which Aristotle no longer appeared merely as the wise philosopher, the advocate of monotheism, but also as a magician and an alchemist. This travesty of the figure of Aristotle that disturbed us so profoundly in the « Sirr-al-asrar » does indeed go back to the Hellenistic original, which thus constituted the starting point for the Arabic apocrypha making Aristotle, on the one hand, an adept of magic and inventor of talismans 68; on the other, the theoretician of military art 69. Thus one cannot avoid asking whether the two letters",

Dans sa reponse, Ie « Philosophe» esquisse un court traite d'alchimie.

Quoi qu'il en soit de ce probleme, dans la premiere partie de sa reponse, Aristote rattache cette pseudo-science aux principes de la physique classique et en donne une explication remarquable par sa clarte et par l'absence de tout penchant vers le mysticisme et la gnose. A n'en point douter, l'auteur de ces lettres se servait d'un traite appartenant a la premiere periode de 1'alchimiegrecque. Cependant, croyons-nous, les lettres elles-memes datent d'une epoque beaucoup plus recente qu'un detail permet, peut-etre, d'etablir. Dans sa reponse, Aristote decerne a Alexandre le titre peu commun de « warit-al-gababira I), l' « heritier des geants I), voire l' « heritier des puissants» et meme « l'heritier des tyrans I), titre qui -soulignons-le tout de suite, -ne se trouve pas dans notre « Roman I).

Consequently, there is a very strong chance that the title of this letter is connected to that of ytyas y,yavTwv, in Syriac « gabbara », a poor translation of the Persian « kavi » (valiant chief) that Ḫosro I had adopted in order to mark the continuity of his power with that of the seven Zoroastrian kings of the Avesta 72. In this case, the two letters, although preserved in a recent ms., would date from the second half of the 6th century, or from the first half of the 7th century, for the memory of the title « kavi », taken by Ḫosro I, was quickly forgotten. If one could be certain that they formed part of our « Romance », the problem of the date of its composition would be almost resolved. Indeed, being the work of a pagan author, —as we shall see— it could only belong to the 6th century. But are there valid reasons to attribute them to our epistolographer? We must confess our perplexity on this matter. Judging by Alexander's missive, they in turn formed part of a collection of letters that did not all concern alchemy 73. Alexander alludes there to the reports previously sent to Aristotle on the countries he had conquered and emphasizes how the task of organizing the Empire and the concern to complete the conquest of the world, scarcely left him the leisure to study these elixirs and obliged him to have recourse to his master 74. One can see that nothing pre-",
    "35": "would prevent these letters from having been part of our Epistolary Romance 75. Moreover, as we shall see, the latter included at least one piece belonging to the classical period. However, a difficulty must be noted. Two main themes recur throughout our \"Romance\": Alexander's duty to conquer Persia to avenge the Greeks, and his mission to restore the ancient divine Law common to the Greeks, Arabs (Jews), Persians, and Hindus. Without doubt, the first of these themes corresponded to what our epistolographer had found in his sources, the second to his own conception of the role of a \"Kosmokrator\". On the other hand, we never find there the other essential trait of the classical legend: the Macedonian King's desire to know the wonders of the world. Now, it is precisely this trait that is highlighted in the correspondence of the Syriac ms. 209 of the Vatican Library, which obliges us to consider the possibility that it belonged to a different cycle 76.\n\nOther letters still seem to have belonged to our Epistolary Romance, those which Ibn Faqīh and Al-Bīrūnī tell us about. Among the letters summarised by Ibn Faqīh 77, two are connected to an episode of the \"De Mirabilibus Indii\", that of the treasures plundered by the Macedonian army in the Kingdom of Porus, an episode found only in the Latin versions of this epistle. In turn, Ta'ālibī and al-Mubašširr had heard of it, but the latter attributed to Olympias, and not to Aristotle, the idea of having suggested to Alexander that he send to Greece a description of the places where he had hidden these riches 78.\n\nOne will not hesitate to admit the belonging of these two letters to the\n\n75 Let us also note the end of Alexander's letter (fol. 2v, l. 2): Cr L:,.;.;iJ ~ .J ~:>\\:J I e:i J J l.R.: :1, .J :i....Q-1 J ..; yL I .J ~ I J 0l.A..:1\\ ~~ .J ).\"...YI ~l;f ~ ~y9yll ~l ~ \"For our intention is to progress in the knowledge of philosophy, to advance in wisdom, to push further in conquering countries and enlarging the kingdom, in order to come to know the wonders (of the Universe) and the truth about them\".\n\n75 Let us also note the end of Alexander's letter (fol. 2v, l. 2): Cr L:,.;.;iJ ~ .J ~:>\\:J I e:i J J l.R.: :1, .J :i....Q-1 J ..; yL I .J ~ I J 0l.A..:1\\ ~~ .J ).\"...YI ~l;f ~ ~y9yll ~l ~ \"For our intention is to progress in the knowledge of philosophy, to advance in wisdom, to push further in conquering countries and enlarging the kingdom, in order to come to know the wonders (of the Universe) and the truth about them\".\n\n76 For the sake of precision, let us add that, in his response, Aristotle mentions his treatise on Physics called here ~ I t~\" whereas in the «as-siyāsat-al-'āmmīya» one encounters the title 0l.::5J\\ L' However, this divergence may come from some copyist.

    "36": "« rasā'il », since, in Ibn Faqīh's summary, they appear with extracts from the « Siyāsat-al-mudun » and the beginning of the summary of the περὶ κόσμου. On the other hand, it is much more difficult to connect to our « Romance » Aristotle's response to Alexander, summarised by al-Bīrūnī 79, concerning the questions posed by the Brahmans about the idols that the Greeks worshipped. These questions take us back to the exchange of letters between Alexander and Dandamis, preserved again and only in two Latin translations 80. They present, as is known, Christian interpolations and precisely a long diatribe against polytheism, to which Alexander finds nothing to oppose. In this way, this interpolation alters the original character of this philosophical confrontation, to our knowledge the only one, in Hellenistic literature, where the representative of the Greek world carried off the palm against an Oriental sage.\n\nIt is evident that the author of the letter summarised by al-Bīrūnī had before his eyes a copy of this correspondence containing the attack against idols, that is to say a text that can hardly be earlier than the fourth century of our era. However, this author modified the problem raised by the Christian interpolator. The question he attributed to the Brahmans no longer concerned polytheism, but the presence of the divine essence in idols. Aristotle's response, declaring that he knew nothing about it, implied a rejection of theurgy and, consequently, of the « haykal » theory of Greek 81 and Arabic Hermeticism.\n\nNow, we have seen how the author of the letters in Syriac ms. 209 of the Vatican Library had withdrawn from the beliefs of his time linking the Great Work to mystical initiations. Therefore, one cannot exclude outright the possibility that the author of our « Romance », probably the same as that of the ps.-Aristotelian letter on alchemy, took the opposite view from the leaders of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism. In this case, one would have to admit that he was close to those very rare commentators on Aristotle who had not forgotten everything of the scientific spirit of their master. Nevertheless, there also exists another possibility. The world",
    "37": "Muslim world knew the legends about Dandamis 82 and probably even the original of our Latin versions of the « De Mirabilibus Indii » 83. Taking these facts into account, in the current state of our knowledge, it is perhaps more prudent to attribute the ps.-Aristotelian letter cited by al-Bīrūnī to a Muslim author aware of the existence of our « Epistolary Romance » and desirous of tracing back to the greatest philosopher of Antiquity a categorical condemnation of the theory of « haykal » and « ḥulūl », incompatible with Islamic orthodoxy 84.\n\nLet us now ask whether, setting aside the letters of ms. Vatican Syriac 209, it is possible to date with some precision our « selected pieces », a problem on which depends their use for the history of political thought in late Hellenism.\n\nIn all likelihood, our epistolographer was a Greek from Egypt or Syria, for in one passage, he alludes to the legends of the Copts, meaning the ancient Αἰγύπτιοι 85. He undoubtedly knew the « Biography of Alexander »; indeed, within the very body of our letters, entire passages which could in no way be interpolations by an Arab author are taken from the « Biography »; thus we read that, in one of his expeditions, Alexander had occupied all of Scythia, an exploit mentioned only in the γ recension of ps.-Callisthenes 86. Differently from this\n\n82 See NÖLDEKE, Beiträge zur Geschichte des Alexanderromans (Denkschriften der K. Akademie der Wiss., Phil. hist. Cl., 38, Abh. 5, Vienna, 1890), pp. 47-48.\n\n83 In the «Murūǧ-aḏ-ḏahab », II, p. 201, Mas'ūdī cites a letter sent by the king of India to Khosrau; the title seems to contain a distant echo of the description of the golden palace of Porus in the Latin version of the «De Mirabilibus Indii ».

Now, in the «as-Siyāsat-al-'āmmiya», the model for the «Kitāb-as-siyāsa », Aristotle declares twice that he writes his letter in response to an oral request, which was addressed to him by the king before his departure. One sees how much caution is required before attributing to our romance the various letters found scattered in Arabic literature.\n\n85 Ms. Aya Sofya, fol. 95v.\n\n86 See note 30. It will be noted that ps.-Callisthenes, γ, I, 23, speaks only of a victory of Alexander against the Scythians, while our epistolographer claims to know that the Macedonian king had occupied Scythia in its entirety. We have here a new example of the exaggerations in which our epistolographer delighted.",
    "38": "version, our epistolographer places this conquest after the expedition to the West and, through a new hyperbole, he claims that the Romans did not limit themselves to making an act of submission to the Macedonian king; they fled before him to the Gauls 87. Furthermore, in the « as-Siyasatal-'ammiya », Alexander addresses to his army a speech filled with features borrowed from classical legends, which parallels that of chap. I, 37 of ps.-Callisthenes; in both cases, the speech is delivered in the presence of Persian ambassadors. Finally, still in this « siyasa », we find a letter from Alexander addressed to the Arabs to praise them for their monotheistic faith. Certainly, in its current form, this epistle belongs, almost entirely, to the author of the « rasa'il », but a ps.-Homeric citation proves incontestably that it replaced a missive from the « Epistolary Romance », in which Alexander undoubtedly signified his adherence to the cult of the fgeos Zwwv. Let us add that, in the « siyasa », this letter precedes the one sent to Porus and a conclusion will be necessary: our epistolographer knew a version of ps.-Callisthenes containing the long report to Olympias and to Aristotle on the expedition to the West. This report—as is known—appears in both redaction β and redaction γ; but one should rather think of the latter, for it alone speaks of an expedition to Scythia. This, moreover, does not at all exclude that the author may have known different versions of the « Biography ».\n\nThe γ redaction of ps.-Callisthenes thus constitutes the « terminus post quem » of our Epistolary Romance. Let us recall the results of M. Simon's study on the relations between the episode of Alexander's conversion to the « living God » in redaction β and in redaction γ 88.

    "40": "fortune, as is told of the people of Maron. These people prayed to God to bring misfortune upon them, in view of the happiness they hoped to attain thereafter» 93.\n\nThere is no doubt that this phrase belongs to the classical author and not to Salim Abu-l-'Ala', who could hardly have had sympathy for Christian minorities, much less cite them as an example to his master. Moreover, the expression «Ahlu-Maruniya» corresponds quite well to those which, in Syriac, designated the monks of the monastery of Saint-Maron in the region of Antioch. Now, in 517, the Jacobites had set an ambush for the monks of Saint-Maron, supporters of the Council of Chalcedon, had massacred a great number of them and, perhaps, devastated their convent. In the memorial submitted to Pope Hormisdas I in 518 and in a report sent to the Orthodox Churches, the archimandrite of this convent spoke precisely of the joy with which he himself and his brethren had endured these persecutions, which enabled them to gain eternal glory 94. In our view, the textual agreement between these passages from the official documents of the Church and the phrase we read in the letter of Aristotle in our Romance, cannot be fortuitous. The Greek epistolographer must have had in mind the episode of these martyrs commemorated each year on 31 July. On the other hand, his expressions seem to imply that some time had elapsed since this massacre. This brings us back to the second half of the 6th century, precisely to the period when Ḫosro I adorned himself with the title of ytyu, ytyavTwv 95.\n\n•\n\n94 MANSI, VIII, col. 425 : « ...

Based on the fact that the latter substitutes twelve times the name of Ḫosro for that of Xerxes, Nöldeke was inclined to attribute it to the reign of Ḫosro Parwīz. It is possible, however, that the Persian translator was thinking rather of King Ḫosro of the Avesta. In our view, the Pahlavi translation should be dated to the middle of the 6th century, for the description of Alexander's journey across Central Asia, even if it goes back to Greek sources, was reworked by a Persian author (see the episode",
    "41": "Obviously, we are thus attributing a gross anachronism to our epistolographer. But, at the end of this same letter, Aristotle, speaking of his youth, recounts that he met Hippocrates 96 in Athens and advises Alexander to make his acquaintance! One might hesitate to believe that a Greek writer imagined that Hippocrates was a contemporary of Alexander, and prefer to attribute this phrase to the Arabic translator. But the author of this passage knew that, in his youth, Aristotle had lived twenty years in Athens, a detail that Salim Abu-l-'Ala' could hardly have known, that he was the friend of Binurqati (Xenocrates!), that, thanks to Plato, he had formed ties with 0.J~ rJ ~ I (!), although the latter did not belong to his generation. Again, this is information that must go back to our epistolographer, who surely was not unaware that Hippocrates had died well before Alexander's birth; however, just like ps.-Callisthenes, he cared little for historical plausibility. We will add further that the date we propose for our epistolary novel based on this letter accords with Zacher's judgment on the linguistic characteristics of the only Greek fragment that has come down to us: the epistle of Alexander dying to Olympias. According to the German scholar, for stylistic and linguistic reasons, it must be the work of an author from the Late Empire, or even from the beginning of the Byzantine period.\n\nRegarding the personality of this epistolographer, we are only able to provide one piece of information. His sympathies went entirely to the ancient classical world. Thus, in a passage of the « as-Siyāsat al-'āmmiya », he puts in Alexander's mouth a long profession of faith, which he probably drew from Hermetic « logoi » with a monist tendency, which brought together the three principles of the « kosmos » (the « sensus mundanus » 97, the « hyle » and the world) with the terms of Proclus's first triad (the πέρας, the ἄπειρον and the μικτόν); moreover, while retaining the Hermetic principle of the voluntary creation of the world by the Divinity, these « logoi » of the dragon of the mountains of the Indus killed by burning copper balls, the Iranian ordeal of molten metal, just like the « deva » Kirm, the « Dragon » in the « Karnamak Artaxšer-i Papakan »). Now this author did not yet know of the Turks. Under these conditions the hypothesis imposes itself that our epistolographer possessed the Greek original of the Pahlavi Romance and that, in his letter of Alexander dying to Olympias, he merely substituted for the dispositions of the testament the parable of the « Bouddhagosha » (3rd century BC), known in the West from the 1st century of our era (Pliny, Hist. Nat., VII, 55, § 189 and Lucian of Samosata, Demonax, ch. 25).\n\n96 Or Socrates, according to a reading preserved in the margins of our two mss.\n\n97 See Asclepius (Corpus Hermeticum, II), § 32.",
    "42": "while preserving the Hermetic principle of the voluntary creation of the world by the Divinity, these «logoi» employed Neo-Platonic terminology, spoke of the EmuTrorP~, of the UATJ and defined the world as a TO I-\"~ DV 98. Fr. Festugière, the eminent specialist of this period of Greek philosophy, has shown decisively that the «Corpus Hermeticum» was never the Bible of a religion 99, which prevents us from considering Alexander's profession of faith as the Symbol of Hermetic conventicles. The passage was undoubtedly written by our epistolographer for the needs of his work; it adds nothing essential to our knowledge of Hermeticism. However, from another point of view, this Hermetic profession of faith deserves attention. It is not a passage for effect, composed for literary purposes; it corresponds rather to the deep convictions of our epistolographer, for it explains certain features of his work which would otherwise be hardly comprehensible. Alexander is represented there as the worshipper of the One God, a God to whom he never offers sacrifices; his goal is to restore the religion of the ancient Sages and Kings, the religion common, in the past, to the Greeks, the Persians, the Arabs (Hebrews) and the Indians. The attribution of a monotheistic cult to peoples whom, with the sole exception of the Hebrews, Christian and Muslim orthodoxies agreed to consider as polytheists, definitively confirms to us that this way of conceiving Alexander's mission could not be the work of the author of the «rasā'il» and that our epistolographer cannot have been Christian. On the contrary, one easily understands that a devotee of the Beos ayvwuToS would have seen no contradiction in making Alexander the adherent of a monotheistic cult and at the same time the restorer of the Ancient Law; and Aristotle—in the manner of Hermes .J 0~.

    "43": "Trismegistus a devotee of God, a philosopher, an alchemist and a magician.\n\nWe even believe that hermeticism helps to understand an even deeper anomaly that our \"Romance\" conceals. At a stretch, one could conceive that one of the last adherents of the ancient cults wanted to make the Macedonian hero, henceforth annexed by Christianity 100, a \"kosmokratōr\" professing the faith revealed by Hermes. However, our epistolographer did not primarily aim to exalt the ancient pagan emperors, which could have corresponded to a desire to polemicize against the Christian Empire. He was rather concerned, throughout his work, with giving moral and political advice, with indicating the indispensable qualities for a sovereign to accomplish his mission. And this, despite the fact that because of his adherence to the ancient religion he could hardly hope to be heard by the sovereigns of the New Rome. One must admit that this pagan believed in the prophecies announcing the return of the true religion 101. But then, his interest in the political problem—an interest quite rare among writers of the Late Empire—would be connected in some way to the exaltation of \"royal souls\" and of royalty that one encounters in the \"Corpus Hermeticum.\" Probably the \"logos\" XVIII of this \"Corpus\" was originally only an epideictic discourse presenting at most a few points of contact with the theses of hermeticism. It nonetheless remains true that, for the author of the \"Corpus Hermeticum,\" the exaltation of kings and the rather banal admonitions of this oration were not foreign to the teaching of Hermes 102. We know the place that Stobaeus, whose inclination toward hermeticism is quite evident, gives to problems of royalty in the fourth book of his \"Anthology.\" Let us also recall that, in the \"Muḫtar al-ḥikam\" of al-Mubassir, we find a long series of political counsels from King Ammon, the disciple of Hermes, translated from a Greek collection 103.",
    "44": "Perhaps these are simple coincidences, but, in studying our « Epistolary Romance », we must take into account the possibility that its author drew inspiration from Hermetic morality and theosophy and sought to represent, in the figure of Alexander, the model of what a true « kosmokrator » should have been, raised in the purely spiritual worship that the prophet of Egypt had revealed.\n\nIn any case, this marked interest of our epistolographer in political problems has given us the partial preservation of a classical treatise « The Art of Governing Cities », which, despite the contrary opinion of Lippert and other Hellenists, Niesse, Pridik, and most recently, Professor Plezia 104 have considered an original work by Aristotle.\n\nThe complete version of this epistle, which moreover constitutes the response to a letter from Alexander whose falsity is glaringly obvious, allows us to exclude this hypothesis. Apart from some very obscure allusions which, it appears, relate to Ostanes, we read there that Alexander was duty-bound to expel the Persians from their country, just as Attalus I had done with the Galatians 105. But in general, the programme proposed in this letter to Alexander has nothing in common with the role assigned to him in « as-Siyasat-al-'ammiya ». He was to avenge the destructions of Miletus and Eretria, deport the Persians, found new cities and give them a constitution. This is precisely the project that the philo-Macedonian Greeks of the 4th century hoped to see realised by Philip and Alexander. Therefore, it is not impossible that, for the composition of this epistle, our epistolographer actually made use of an Aristotelian treatise now lost. Moreover he had\n\n104 Menander (Warsaw 1964), De Aristotelis epistula ad Alexandrum arabice tradita. Judging by the short Latin summary of this article, Professor Plezia would have reached the conclusion that the letter in question was written by Aristotle himself and would relate to the events of the years 331-330.\n\nj~ ... ~ 0~\n\n105 Ms. Aya Sofya 4260, fol. 86r; Fatih, fol. 76r : .;!j l!..U~ ~ 0-\" tJ..:!.)

In this article, it sufficed for us to demonstrate how the Arabic mss have preserved for us a Greek epistolary novel and to indicate its importance even for the history of the last period of classical civilization. Perhaps one day we will be able to make an indirect contribution to these studies through an edition of the « as-Siyasat-al'ammiya », which interests us, as an orientalist, from the perspective of the influence of classical theories on the political thought of Islam.\n\nTrieste-Opicina, Via Nazionale, 12.\n\nMario GRIGNASCHI.\n\n106 Aya Sofya, fol. 26r : 0~1 c- ~ \\.;Jj L ~~ J.'J.::JJJI .J ~~L:..~I.J ~l9I~1 c- J1 0\";~ 0~10r «The proof [of the excellence of philosophy] is given to us by what we have said in the « Physike Akroasis » on the desire of young men to listen to legends and tales ».\n\n106 Aya Sofya, fol. 26r : 0~1 c- ~ \\.;Jj L ~~ J.'J.::JJJI .J ~~L:..~I.J ~l9I~1 c- J1 0\";~ 0~10r «The proof [of the excellence of philosophy] is given to us by what we have said in the « Physike Akroasis » on the desire of young men to listen to legends and tales ».\n\n107 In the study of this letter, one must take into account that the original text was subjected to at least two reworkings: the first by our epistolographer, the second by the author of the «rasail ».

    "55": "Excerpt from sentences pronounced by philosophers. One said: \"Alexander has moved us by his silence\". Aristotle said: \"Alexander left us speaking and returns to us in silence\". Another said: \"We came into the world ignorant, we remain there heedless [of the future] and we leave it reluctantly\". Mihltus said: \"O brutal collector, you have gathered what betrayed you when you wanted to use it, what abandoned you at the moment of need. Neither can parents henceforth visit you, nor can vizirs save you\". Polemon said: \"Behold a great day. It has brought the misfortune it kept distant and has made flee the good it brought. He who wept over the passing of his kingdom has much to weep about\". Excerpt from sentences pronounced by his relatives and by his intimates. One said: \"What makes us desire that from which you have parted, and makes us forget what you saw with your own eyes?\". Ellihtm said: \"Your power has vanished like a cloud carried by the wind and the traces of your kingdom have faded as fade the traces of unstable clouds\". Another said: \"O brutal collector, you have gathered what has abandoned you and turned its back on you. You have taken upon yourself all its weight and others than you will profit from it\". Another said: \"O you, for whom the world was too narrow in length and breadth, may I understand how you will find yourself in the little earth that will enclose you!\". Another said: \"Yesterday, you gathered gold; today it is gold that encloses you\". Another said: \"How easily men do without you and how they covet your coffer\". Other sentences also pronounced about Alexander. \"I know it, the expanse of the earth was narrow for you. How will you find yourself in the narrow space that will enclose you?\". Another said: \"O you who overthrew kings, how did you consider the fact that death has overthrown you in turn?\". Another said: \"Behold a journey such as Alexander has never undertaken, without provisions and without companions\"."

Despite its lack of originality—Steinschneider had even defined it as «eine teilweisemiserable Compilation philosophierender Mystik und vulgaren Aberglaubens» 2—the «Sirr-al-asrar» had, as is known, an extraordinary success among the Latins, attested by the two hundred manuscripts and more still existing today in libraries, and by the numerous translations into the most diverse languages of Europe. For this reason—Steinschneider himself had admitted it—this work merited a particular study. However, our preparatory work advanced very slowly, especially for a psychological reason. While working to collect and collate the texts of the Arabic versions and the translations into Latin and vernacular languages, we had the precise feeling of dealing with a text reworked by a relatively recent Arab writer, who would have suppressed the properly political part of this «siyasatnamah» to graft onto it long chapters on magic, medicine, and physiognomy. Only the encouragement lavished by Professor Morghen prevented us from abandoning a work we deemed sterile. The numerous modern studies of this work, unanimous or nearly so in attributing the «Sirr-al-asrar» to Yuhanna-bnu Batriq, helped us very little. Thus we took as the basis of our research the chapter dedicated to this «siyasatnamah» by Steinschneider in his book «Die hebraischen Uebersetzungen aus dem Arabischen», a veritable mine of information",

Influenced, unknowingly, by the preface of this work, the scholars who had dealt with it had always considered the presence of passages parallel to the «Sirr-al-asrār» in the works of the «Iḫwān-aṣ-ṣafā» and of Ibn 'Abdi Rabbihi as proof that these authors already knew our pseudo-Aristotelian treatise 3. In fact, this reasoning had to be reversed, and it was on the contrary the author of the «Sirr-al-asrār» who had drawn from these encyclopedias in order to enrich his own text 4.",

        "text": "4 In order to establish this, one only has to read, in the version of Manṣūr Nawālī (ms. Hafiz ef.-Süleymaniye 253, fol. 63 v), the beginning of the «bāb» of the «Kitāb-as-siyāsa fī tadbīr-i-r-ri'āsa» on «the qualities and number of viziers, as well as the manner of testing their intelligence and their views». The author, who was certainly not a philosopher, cited at the head of this «bāb» the principle stated by the «Iḫwān-aṣ-ṣafā» in the 1st «risāla» of Book III, namely that it is indispensable to know oneself before the things of the world (Bombay ed., vol. III, p. 9, l. 4-7). After which, he continued by copying pages 7, l. 24-end; 8, l. 1; 9, l. 7-9; 11, l. 27-end; 12, l. 1-2; 13, l. 8-22, of this same «risāla». In this way, he happened, inadvertently, to attribute to the universal soul the powers proper, according to the «Iḫwān-aṣ-ṣafā», to the vegetative soul governing the foetus. —For his part, the author of the «Sirr-al-asrār» proceeded in exactly the same way. He added to the extracts from the encyclopedia of the «Iḫwān-aṣ-ṣafā» chosen by his predecessor a passage from page 8 (l. 1-18 and 20-26) of the same «risāla»; he replaced the invitation to know oneself before the things of the world at the place where it appears in the encyclopedia; but above all he omitted lines 21-22 of p. 13, perhaps because they implied the principle of metempsychosis. Finally, he added to these pages the paraphrase of some extracts from the IVth «risāla» of Book III and from the Xth «risāla» of Book II. But he did not notice the gross error that existed in his model and continued to attribute to the universal soul the powers proper to the vegetative soul!",

We then continued our research in the libraries of Istanbul in the hope of finding the Arabic text. They remained unsuccessful, but led us to the discovery of two other volumes: ms. Aya Sofya 4260 and ms. Köprülü 1608, the latter, we were unaware at the time, already studied by Kraemer. Both contained a treatise the « as-Siyāsat-al-'āmmīya » which is also found in Arabic ms. 2422 of the Bibliothèque Nationale de Paris. Of course, this latter ms. had not escaped Steinschneider; but this scholar had relied on the catalogue indication, according to which it was a simple variant of the « Sirr-al-asrar ». On the contrary, already according to a superficial examination, the « as-Siyāsat-al-'āmmīya » revealed itself to be an even older version of the « Sirr-al-asrar », and more precisely the source of this « Kitāb-as-siyāsa », which Nawālī had translated into Turkish. And what is more, in the context of ms. Aya Sofya 4260, this « as-Siyāsat-al-'āmmīya » acquired a new significance. It came to constitute the centrepiece of an Arabic epistolary novel, deriving, quite evidently, from a Hellenistic original, connected in some way to the Romance of ps-Callisthenes.",

However, a meticulous examination of piece VIII, the «as-Siyasat al'ammiya» has allowed us to collect a long series of passages that confirm this attribution. It will suffice here to indicate the most conclusive ones that we have examined and published in our article on this work from the point of view of Umayyad civilization. The Arab author, for example, openly displays his contempt for freedmen and for slaves; when he happens to speak of the high personages upon whom the life of the Caliph depended, he hardly mentions the vizirate. The Arab army that he describes had an aristocratic character, the «ṣufūf» constituted its battle formation, the «karādīsa» being mentioned only as tactical units of the Turkish cavalry, and combats still began with duels between «champions». The enemy that this author feared the most were the Turks. As for the Khorassanians, they appear in this «siyāsa» as a warlike people, whose goodwill it was important for the caliph to win. Nowhere are we told that this population was devoted to the cause of the dynasty, as was the case in the Abbasid period. Finally, the author of this «siyāsa» must have occupied an elevated position at the court of his sovereign and we know from Ṭabarī, from Al-Kindī and from al-Mas'ūdī that in fact Salim Abū-l-'Alā' enjoyed the full confidence of Hišām b. 'Abdi-l-Malik.",

De meme l'introduction a la piece XIV (la « Lettre du Palais d'Or ») derive, ainsi que M.Stern l'a demontre, de la description du temple de Dionysos a Nysa qu'on retrouve dans les versions syriaque et arabe du ps. Callisthene 19. On attribuera encore a cet auteur arabe le court debut des lettres XI et XII qu'il a ajoutees, tout comme I'epitre XIV, aux morceaux d'origine classique 20. Par contre, les autres introductions doivent remonter a l'epistolographe grec car elles renferment des renseignements necessaires pour l'intelligence des pieces elles-memes, renseignements qu'il n'aurait pas eMfacile a Salim de tirer de leur texte. Sans doute, l'ecrivain arabe s'est borne ales remanier. La preuve, nous la voyons dans I'introduction de la lettre XIII 21. En effet, la lettre elle-meme ne mentionne nullement le Khorassan et ils est evident que, dans l'original, il n'etait pas question d'une conquete de cette province, mais bien de l'expedition au bout du monde que, d'apres les versions f3 et y du ps.

Now, it is clear that the Arab author had found these names in the original, for he manifestly knew nothing of these personages 29. Moreover, in this letter, one encounters a τόπος going back to Prodicus: if Heracles had sought only pleasure and love, he would never have executed the twelve labours that made him famous.",

He did not manage to encircle them, as you have done. We have not heard that any king of times past conquered their country. They, on the other hand, seized all the countries of Asia, certain countries of Europe, Thrace, and still more other countries belonging to the Rum, and they penetrated into the interior of their Empire ·. One cannot escape the impression that the Scythians of the Greek epistolographer, who were more powerful than those of the time of Darius I, were none other than the Huns. This would explain why he attributed to them on the one hand the conquest of Thrace and incursions into the interior of the Roman Empire, and on the other the devastation of all of Asia.

But, upon careful examination of his «Apophthegms», one realizes that in the original, it was a question of illness and that the words inserted in the title of this chapter «he had drunk a poison» are only a gloss 60. Indeed, this account by Ḥunayn is placed in the same context as that of al-Mubassir. Both believed they knew that Alexander had died after a visit to the city of the Gymnosophists. The only difference is that Ḥunayn gives a version of this visit that differs slightly from that of al-Mubassir 61. Therefore, only the anonymous author of the «History of the Death of Alexander» connects this letter to the episode of the poisoning.

Moreover, the theme of prophecy recurs regularly in the pieces of our Roman epistolaire. This suffices to say that, in its essential features, the same version of the death of the Macedonian king appears both in the « rasa'il » and in the Arabic « Biography» of Alexander. But then, to which of these two works did this version originally belong? Only one answer is possible to this question in the present state of our knowledge. It must have appeared in our « Roman epistolaire », for it is only by this hypothesis that one can explain two facts at once: the interpolation of an abridgement of this same letter in a recent Greek redaction of ps.-Callisthenes and the appearance, within the Arabic « Biography», of a version of Alexander's death foreign to the Greek « Biography», but of Hellenistic origin, as the « Apophtegmes des philosophes» prove.

Coming to his senses, he remembered how, according to a prophecy, his death would have taken place under a golden sky and on an iron earth. According to Eutychius and al-Mubassir, this sign would have been foreseen by the astrologers. Eutychius even specifies that the astrologers had seen it at the moment of his birth and had informed Olympias. Ta'ālibi attributes the omen to Ptolemy Lagos, the « Kitab Isṭamāḫis » cited in « Picatrix » (II, book III, chap. VI) to Aristotle who would have informed Alexander by letter. Even in the « Roman ethiopien », p. 293, signs, which the translator unfortunately does not specify, announce to Alexander that his death is imminent. Only Mas'ūdī does not speak of it, while accepting, in his «Murūǧ », the same version of the letter to Olympias.

This version, let us note in passing, does not contain pieces analogous to those of the « Arab Novel », as M. Merkelbach believed. The three pieces published in appendix to the « Biography » and which were not translated by Raabe, would belong, according to the editor of the Armenian version, to the popular literature of the Middle Ages. We owe this information to the Mechitarist Fathers of Venice. - Let us admit however that it is not easy to trace back to the « Epistolary Novel » the assertion of the « Arab Novel » according to which Alexander would have died in Kurdistan at Sahrzur or, according to al-Mubassir, in the village of ~ l)...... -'J near Sahrzur.

Finally, let us recall that, in another epistle to Alexander, the « Kitab-al-Istamayis », Aristotle alludes to the amulet « al-Amatis » designed to protect the King from snow and rain, which brings us back once more to the « De Mirabilibus Indie ». Certainly, the « Kitab-al-Istamayis », partially preserved in ms. Oxford Marsh 556, does not belong to our Hellenistic Romance. Of this work, we know only the citations of ps. al-Magrit! in his « Picatrix », but they suffice to prove that its author was already inspired by our letter XI 67. Consequently, it is an Islamic magical treatise. Nevertheless, taking into account the passage from the « aa-Siyaeat-al-tammiya » that we have just cited, one must indeed consider the hypothesis that, just as was the case for the « Sirr-al-asrar », the « Kitab-al-Istamfthlar is actually derived from a letter of our epistolary romance through more or less profound reworkings. Above all, what cannot be doubted is that our romance already contained pages in which Aristotle no longer appeared merely as the wise philosopher, the advocate of monotheism, but also as a magician and an alchemist. This travesty of the figure of Aristotle that disturbed us so profoundly in the « Sirr-al-asrar » does indeed go back to the Hellenistic original, which thus constituted the starting point for the Arabic apocrypha making Aristotle, on the one hand, an adept of magic and inventor of talismans 68; on the other, the theoretician of military art 69.

On the other hand, we never find there the other essential trait of the classical legend: the Macedonian King's desire to know the wonders of the world.

Moreover, the expression «Ahlu-Maruniya» corresponds quite well to those which, in Syriac, designated the monks of the monastery of Saint-Maron in the region of Antioch. Now, in 517, the Jacobites had set an ambush for the monks of Saint-Maron, supporters of the Council of Chalcedon, had massacred a great number of them and, perhaps, devastated their convent. In the memorial submitted to Pope Hormisdas I in 518 and in a report sent to the Orthodox Churches, the archimandrite of this convent spoke precisely of the joy with which he himself and his brethren had endured these persecutions, which enabled them to gain eternal glory 94. In our view, the textual agreement between these passages from the official documents of the Church and the phrase we read in the letter of Aristotle in our Romance, cannot be fortuitous. The Greek epistolographer must have had in mind the episode of these martyrs commemorated each year on 31 July. On the other hand, his expressions seem to imply that some time had elapsed since this massacre. This brings us back to the second half of the 6th century, precisely to the period when Ḫosro I adorned himself with the title of ytyu, ytyavTwv 95.",

Based on the fact that the latter substitutes twelve times the name of Ḫosro for that of Xerxes, Nöldeke was inclined to attribute it to the reign of Ḫosro Parwīz. It is possible, however, that the Persian translator was thinking rather of King Ḫosro of the Avesta. In our view, the Pahlavi translation should be dated to the middle of the 6th century, for the description of Alexander's journey across Central Asia, even if it goes back to Greek sources, was reworked by a Persian author (see the episode",

One might hesitate to believe that a Greek writer imagined that Hippocrates was a contemporary of Alexander, and prefer to attribute this phrase to the Arabic translator. But the author of this passage knew that, in his youth, Aristotle had lived twenty years in Athens, a detail that Salim Abu-l-'Ala' could hardly have known, that he was the friend of Binurqati (Xenocrates!), that, thanks to Plato, he had formed ties with 0.J~ rJ ~ I (!), although the latter did not belong to his generation. Again, this is information that must go back to our epistolographer, who surely was not unaware that Hippocrates had died well before Alexander's birth; however, just like ps.-Callisthenes, he cared little for historical plausibility. We will add further that the date we propose for our epistolary novel based on this letter accords with Zacher's judgment on the linguistic characteristics of the only Greek fragment that has come down to us: the epistle of Alexander dying to Olympias. According to the German scholar, for stylistic and linguistic reasons, it must be the work of an author from the Late Empire, or even from the beginning of the Byzantine period.",

Alexander is represented there as the worshipper of the One God, a God to whom he never offers sacrifices; his goal is to restore the religion of the ancient Sages and Kings, the religion common, in the past, to the Greeks, the Persians, the Arabs (Hebrews) and the Indians. The attribution of a monotheistic cult to peoples whom, with the sole exception of the Hebrews, Christian and Muslim orthodoxies agreed to consider as polytheists, definitively confirms to us that this way of conceiving Alexander's mission could not be the work of the author of the «rasā'il» and that our epistolographer cannot have been Christian.

At a stretch, one could conceive that one of the last adherents of the ancient cults wanted to make the Macedonian hero, henceforth annexed by Christianity 100, a \"kosmokratōr\" professing the faith revealed by Hermes. However, our epistolographer did not primarily aim to exalt the ancient pagan emperors, which could have corresponded to a desire to polemicize against the Christian Empire. He was rather concerned, throughout his work, with giving moral and political advice, with indicating the indispensable qualities for a sovereign to accomplish his mission. And this, despite the fact that because of his adherence to the ancient religion he could hardly hope to be heard by the sovereigns of the New Rome. One must admit that this pagan believed in the prophecies announcing the return of the true religion 101. But then, his interest in the political problem—an interest quite rare among writers of the Late Empire—would be connected in some way to the exaltation of \"royal souls\" and of royalty that one encounters in the \"Corpus Hermeticum.\" Probably the \"logos\" XVIII of this \"Corpus\" was originally only an epideictic discourse presenting at most a few points of contact with the theses of hermeticism. It nonetheless remains true that, for the author of the \"Corpus Hermeticum,\" the exaltation of kings and the rather banal admonitions of this oration were not foreign to the teaching of Hermes 102. We know the place that Stobaeus, whose inclination toward hermeticism is quite evident, gives to problems of royalty in the fourth book of his \"Anthology.\" Let us also recall that, in the \"Muḫtar al-ḥikam\" of al-Mubassir, we find a long series of political counsels from King Ammon, the disciple of Hermes, translated from a Greek collection 103.",

He was to avenge the destructions of Miletus and Eretria, deport the Persians, found new cities and give them a constitution. This is precisely the project that the philo-Macedonian Greeks of the 4th century hoped to see realised by Philip and Alexander.
