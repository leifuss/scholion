    "2": "The world is spherical, like an apple The orb, also referred to as apple (from the Latin pomum), orbe or globe, forms part of the repertoire of regalia insignia that defines the symbolism of power in the Middle Ages 1. Its round shape evokes the world that is placed in the hands of the sovereign for him to protect and govern, and that world is, indeed, spherical. The idea of the sphericity of the Earth, attributed to Pythagoras (ca. 585-ca. 495 BC) by the Greek historian Diogenes Laertius (3rd century AD) in his Lives, Opinions, and Sentences of the Most Illustrious Philosophers (VIII, 15), endured practically continuously throughout the Medieval period 2. Many medieval maps represent the Earth as circular and flat due to the difficulty posed by the graphic conquest of the third dimension and because when mapping the world, only the small terrestrial portion that emerged from a sphere mostly composed of water was illustrated 3. The Franciscan monk Matfre Ermengaud (fl. 1288-1322) stated in his Breviario de amor (1288-1292) that 'The sea water girds and covers the earth on all sides except one, which God left for us so that we could dwell upon it. And, in comparison, the part that the water leaves uncovered is very small, as small as what would protrude from an apple placed in water. And the part of the earth has veins of water running through it, for otherwise it would dry out excessively and turn to dust' 4. That is to say, the earth is like an apple floating in water 5. The scientific translation of this cosmic image could find its echo in representations such as the one that",

The sphericity of the earth, and likewise its simile with an apple, were reiterated by the French encyclopedist Gautier or Gossouin de Metz (thirteenth century), who suggested a hypothetical journey around the world in his Image du monde: 'The earth is round, and if there were no obstacles, a man could traverse it, as a fly circles around an apple; two men could separate, marching in opposite directions, one towards the East, the other towards the West, so that they would meet again at the antipodes' 7.

    "4": "The orb, an insignia of sovereignty Like the other insignias of sovereignty, principally together with the vestments, the crown and the sceptre, the orb has its origin and foundation in Roman imperial etiquette 8 . Roman emperors, and by extension gods of the classical pantheon, were portrayed with the world in their hand. This gesture and the object itself passed to the Middle Ages to define the power of nobles, kings and emperors, and also of the divinity. In this transmission from Antiquity to the Medieval period, the orb and the manner of holding it underwent a series of transformations. In contrast to the pre-eminence attained by other insignias -for example the sceptre, which was carried in the right hand as a hierarchical sign of distinction-, the orb acquired an inferior status, as it was generally placed in the left hand and could be used by female sovereigns 9 . Furthermore, it came to be crowned by a cross and/or fleur-de-lis, both symbols of the Christianised world that the sovereign, in his capacity as vicar of the divinity, was obliged to preserve 10 . This can be deduced, for example, from the Castigos e documentos del rey don Sancho IV , a Castilian treatise intended for the education of the crown prince from the late thirteenth century, in which the regalia insignia of 'vn rey muy noble' are described, among which is included an orb that, note well, is referred to as 'manzana': 'En la su mano siniestra tenie vna mançana redonda toda de oro, e encima de la mançana, vna cruz de oro. E la mançana es a semejança del regno que deue tener el rey en su mano e apoderarse del' 11 . Despite being a common element in the portraiture of power in the Middle Ages, very few examples of medieval orbs have survived to the present day and, moreover, within medieval Europe, they did not achieve the same popularity in all territories. It was undoubtedly in the Holy Roman Empire where sovereigns identified themselves most clearly with this insignia and, consequently, many Germanic orbs are preserved and very numerous are the portraits of emperors displaying them. In contrast, in the French and Hispanic kingdoms the orb was slow to gain importance 12 , with the Crown of Aragon standing out to a certain extent, 8 For the orb, see the excellent work of P.E.

Thus, for example, according to Jerónimo Zurita in the Anales de la Corona de Aragón and, subsequently, Jerónimo de Blancas in the Coronaciones de los reyes y reinas de Aragón, King Fernando I of Aragon, who died in 1416, had requested in his will (dictated in Perpignan on 10 October 1415) to be buried with royal vestments and insignia—among which the orb figured—similar to those with which he had been crowned 15.\n\nOrbs with a cross finial have been found in the sarcophagi of emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, such as Henry III (d. 1056) 16, Lothair II or III (d. 1137) 17, or Sigismund (d. 1437) 18, as well as in that of Rudolf I, King of Bohemia (d. 1307) 19. Equally interesting for funerary orbs is the engraving of the remains of Emperor Frederick II Hohenstaufen (d. 1250), made by Francesco Daniele during the opening of the sarcophagus in the restoration work at the Cathedral of Palermo between 1781 and 1799, and published in I regali sepolcri del Duomo di Palermo riconosciuti ed illustrati, Naples, 1784. The image shows that the body of the sovereign was embalmed and buried with his corresponding insignia—vestments, crown, sword, and the orb—; the latter, described by Daniele himself as 'il pomo o globo di metallo, mancante però della sua croce; e trovossi pieno di terra' 20, appears to have rolled next to the head of the deceased.\n\nOther orbs also from the Holy Roman Empire were illustrated in an engraving by Johann Adam Delsenbach made in Nuremberg in 1751 21. It was in this German city where, between 1424 and 1796, much of what is currently known as the Reich or Imperial Treasury (the imperial insignia medieval', M.L.

    "6": "of the kings of the Germanic peoples and emperors of the Holy Roman Empire), specifically the group known as Nürnberger Kleinodien (the jewels of Nuremberg). In Delsenbach's engraving, the obverse and reverse of Der Reichsapfel appear, the most important imperial orb preserved from the Middle Ages, known by its name ('the orb') in German, possibly made in Cologne in the twelfth century for the coronation of Henry VI (in 1191) or Philip of Swabia (in Mainz, 1198), or for a rival of the latter, Otto IV of the Welf dynasty (in Aachen, 1198) 22 . Alongside this, two other orbs now lost appear in the engraving. Despite the apparent similarity of the three, a detailed comparison reveals interesting differences, both in the spherical body and in the crowning crosses.\n\nA similar appreciation of formal differences in illustrated orbs is that raised by Amadeo Serra Desfilis in his study of the genealogical roll of the Crown of Aragon (ca. 1410), known as the Genealogy of Poblet because it is preserved today in the library of that monastery. This researcher notes that the cross on the orb of King Martin I the Humane (1396-1410) is very different from the crosses of Sobrarbe that crown the orbs of his predecessors, whereby 'this detail raises the question of whether the cross, almost fleur-de-lysed rather than pattée, could offer the image of a new piece from the royal treasury destined to replace the one that had belonged to Peter the Ceremonious' 23 . Another detail from the Genealogy of Poblet, specifically the pentimento showing that the illuminator, once having completed the portrait of the Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer IV, erased the florons from his headpiece to thereby transform a royal crown into a comital one (into a richly decorated garland or diadem) 24 , seems to confirm the fidelity of this work in the representation of insignia, which, consequently, reaffirms the idea that the differences in the orbs did not respond to the artist's imagination, but to a copy of reality. It is interesting to note, moreover, that the Count of Barcelona appears with a cruciferous orb in his left hand, which would be interpreted in this case as a symbol of sovereignty, that is, not as a royal insignia, since it was not corrected as the royal crown was.\n\nThe tripartite orb of 'T-in-O': origin and evolution\n\nIf we look with these same eyes at the variety of illustrated orbs existing in the figurative arts of the Middle Ages, we could suggest that the formal differences are not mere decorative artifice by the authors of these images, but rather respond to an evocation of different models. Of all of them, the most frequent is what we shall henceforth call the 'tripartite orb'. The insistence of its representation in the hands of emperors, kings, nobles and also of the divinity, as well as the abun-",
    "7": "dance of sumptuary examples that have come down from among the regalia insignia of later centuries—from the sixteenth to the present day 25—suggests that this type of insignia may have already existed in the Middle Ages, although none of them have been preserved. Perhaps they had already disappeared from the Germanic Imperial Treasury when in 1751 Johann Adam Delsenbach made his engraving of the jewels of Nuremberg, for the relic book Wie das hochwirdigist..., produced in 1487 also in Nuremberg (where, as we mentioned, these regalia insignia were kept), does incorporate a woodcut in which two of these tripartite orbs make their appearance 26.\n\nThe tripartite orb results from dividing the sphere horizontally in half and then dividing one of these halves into two vertically. In its formal conception it bears a very close relationship to medieval cartographic sources, specifically to the schematic tripartite 'T-O' maps (Fig. 2). The 'T' is a stylised representation of the three water channels that separate the three continents then known: the left horizontal arm is the Tanais (River Don), the right is the Nile, and the vertical stem is the Mediterranean Sea 27; the 'O' is the surrounding ocean that embraces the earth, as if it were a river. Asia is located in the upper half and in the lower half, Europe on the left and Africa on the right. These maps are oriented in the literal sense of the word, that is, the East is placed at the top, in the preeminent position according to medieval Christian spatial hierarchy. The prominence accorded to this continent is due to the fact that it is where the sun rises—a celestial body intimately associated with the divinity 28—and where the earthly paradise is found, as recorded in Genesis (II, 8) and as many medieval maps show 29. Although the conception of the tripartite world and these natural divisions of the three continents have their origin in Antiquity 30, these geographical notions were assimilated in the Middle Ages with the biblical account of the division of the world among the three sons of Noah—Shem, Japheth, and Ham—after the universal flood 31. For this reason, many of these maps allude textually and graphically to this distribution of lands and to those who were their heirs 32.\n\nT-O maps are, of all medieval cartography, the most numerous quantitatively and those that achieved the greatest popularity over time: the oldest ones we preserve are dated to the seventh–eighth centuries and continued to be pro-",

Its rise influenced the image of the world symbolised in the orb, to the point that we could speak of a 'tripartite T-O orb'. Among the many existing examples in medieval figurative arts, we shall highlight two of them that are significant for their varied approaches: Emperor Augustus appears portrayed in a manuscript of the Liber floridus of Lambert of Saint-Omer (ca. 1250-1275) with a T-O orb in his left hand (Fig. 2), where, as on maps, the names of the three continents are indicated (Asia, Europa, and Affrica) 34 . Likewise, the Christ Child appears with a T-O orb on the shoulders of Saint Christopher in the altarpiece of this saint made in the 14th century 35 . In this case, the tripartition of the world evokes air (the sky with the sun, moon, and stars), water (fish), and earth (castles), something we also frequently find in medieval maps, for example, in the representation of the mappamundi of Darius's tomb in the Alexander in 33    It appears in the printed edition of Saint Isidore's Etymologies produced in Augsburg in 1472 by Günther Zainer, and it is the first printed map. 35 Museo Nacional del Prado (cat. no.

Such is the relationship between this cartographic model and this insignia of sovereignty that in many cases the apparent flatness of the world evoked by cartographic images was reiterated in the latter. Many other medieval images of the tripartite world managed to simulate the spherical sense of the Earth, giving the 'T' a three-dimensional form. This occurs in the image of the English poet John Gower (ca. 1330-1408) shooting arrows at a sphere in a manuscript of his Vox Clamantis (Voice of the Prophet) from 1399-1408 38 : again the tripartite sphere embodies three of the natural elements (air, earth and water). This same sphericity appears in some illustrated orbs, especially from the fifteenth century onwards and with the development of Flemish painting. The oil technique allowed the representation through a system of glazes of a crystalline sphere, which in turn, allowed the rear part of the three-dimensional 'T' to show through. Thus it appears, for example, in the Salvator mundi (ca. 1500-1510) by the Flemish painter Quentin Massys 39 or, within the Hispano-Flemish sphere, in the Salvador by Pedro Berruguete (ca. 1490) 40 (Fig. 3).

    "10": "But those spherical crystal images should not be understood as mere technical displays of Flemish oil painting, but rather as evocations of the medieval conception of the universe, in which Aristotelian and Ptolemaic ideas and Christian theology are synthesised. The universe was conceived as spherical, finite, and geocentric. The Earth, composed of the material substances earth, water, air, and fire, was located at the centre and around it, eight homocentric spheres with the known planets (including the sun and the moon) and the fixed stars, made of a crystalline and transparent substance, rotated thanks to the Primum mobile or First Mover 41 (Fig. 1). This crystalline universe is thus what the aforementioned paintings reproduce in the hands of the divinity. And while on the spherical crystal of Massys typically Flemish buildings and towers are reflected, which perhaps evoke the inhabited world or the place where this work was made 42, Berruguete's sphere additionally reveals another sphere inside it, upon which schematic images of cities rise, and which we could identify with the Earth 43. Likewise, it is interesting to note that, as can be seen in these orbs, over time, the 'T' —that geographic convention with which the world was divided into three continents and Asia was given pre-eminence— becomes inverted, most probably to convert it into a supporting structure for the cross, with which the orbs are crowned. This inversion of the 'T' brought with it a loss of the original cartographic resonance of the 'T-O' maps. Only thus can it be explained that these orbs achieved great success from the sixteenth century onwards, when the traditional tripartite division of the world entered into crisis following the discovery of America 44. The geographic orb and fifteenth-century cartography Thus, as history approaches its modernity, the geographic reference and the symbolic meaning of the 'T-O' of the tripartite orb gradually fade. But the connections of this insignia with geography and cartography do not disappear, but rather materialise in another model of orb, which we will call the 'geographic orb', because in its formal conception a more realistic drawing of the world takes precedence. Behind this geographic realism lie the cartographic advances that took place in Florence in the fifteenth century and that determined the end of",
    "11": "medieval cartography and the birth of modern cartography. On the one hand, the recovery in the West of the Geografía of Claudius Ptolemy (ca. 100-ca. 170), which arrived in Florence at the end of the fourteenth century among the manuscripts brought from Constantinople by Manuel Chrysoloras, and translated into Latin by him and by Jacopo Angeli (1406-1409) 45 . The great popularity achieved by this Ptolemaic work lies in the fact that it explained, for the first time in a scientific manner, how to project a sphere onto a flat surface and, consequently, how to make maps. Paradoxically, Ptolemy's Geografía ended up being useful not only for transferring the sphere to the plane, but also for recreating the three-dimensional image of the world on a two-dimensional support 46 , ultimately, for the subject that concerns us here: the representation of the Earth on illustrated pommels or orbs. In the artistic concern to graphically show the so-called 'third projection', where the Greek geographer asks 'in what way can the visible hemisphere of the Earth contained under an armillary sphere be represented on a plane' (Book 7, chap. 6) 47 , an anonymous author incorporated between 1503-1516 an image that resolved this question in a Florentine manuscript of Ptolemy's Geografía, made around 1470 48 (Fig. 4): on the sphere of the Earth a Ptolemaic mappamundi is projected, in which only the known world is mapped (the rest remains blank) 49 . This artistic solution to the third projection was only surpassed in 1525 by Albrecht Dürer, author of the corresponding image in the printed edition of Willibald Pirckheimer, made in Strasbourg in 1525 50 . In his engraving, Dürer adhered more closely to the laws of perspective by diminishing the distance between the meridians as their distance from the viewer's eye increased, thus creating the artifice of a three-dimensional globe.",

The influence of the cartographies of Claudius Ptolemy and Henricus Martellus Germanus is present in the first preserved terrestrial globe, the work of the German Martin Behaim (1492) 52 . Very similar in its geographical image is the orb held in the hand of the Salvator mundi by Marco d'Oggiono (ca. 1500) 53 , where to the elements of the Ptolemaic tradition, such as the location of the triangular Trapobana (Sri Lanka) on the equator, are added other Martellian features: Asia with 'dragon's tail' or Africa completely circumnavigated (Fig. 4). Also similar is the orb with which a figure, perhaps Claudius Ptolemy himself, appears portrayed by Raphael Sanzio in The School of Athens (1509-1512) in the Stanza della Segnatura of the Vatican Palaces. Finally, these defining features of modern cartography are felt very clearly in the coronation orb of Eric XIV king of Sweden (1561) 54 , which although it preserves the tripartite structure of the 'T-O' has already shed the medieval cartographic reminiscence (Fig. 5).",

Its round shape evokes the world that is placed in the hands of the sovereign for him to protect and govern, and that world is, indeed, spherical. The idea of the sphericity of the Earth, attributed to Pythagoras (ca. 585-ca. 495 BC) by the Greek historian Diogenes Laertius (3rd century AD) in his Lives, Opinions, and Sentences of the Most Illustrious Philosophers (VIII, 15), endured practically continuously throughout the Medieval period 2. Many medieval maps represent the Earth as circular and flat due to the difficulty posed by the graphic conquest of the third dimension and because when mapping the world, only the small terrestrial portion that emerged from a sphere mostly composed of water was illustrated 3. The Franciscan monk Matfre Ermengaud (fl. 1288-1322) stated in his Breviario de amor (1288-1292) that",

        "text": "Like the other insignias of sovereignty, principally together with the vestments, the crown and the sceptre, the orb has its origin and foundation in Roman imperial etiquette 8 . Roman emperors, and by extension gods of the classical pantheon, were portrayed with the world in their hand. This gesture and the object itself passed to the Middle Ages to define the power of nobles, kings and emperors, and also of the divinity. In this transmission from Antiquity to the Medieval period, the orb and the manner of holding it underwent a series of transformations. In contrast to the pre-eminence attained by other insignias -for example the sceptre, which was carried in the right hand as a hierarchical sign of distinction-, the orb acquired an inferior status, as it was generally placed in the left hand and could be used by female sovereigns 9 . Furthermore, it came to be crowned by a cross and/or fleur-de-lis, both symbols of the Christianised world that the sovereign, in his capacity as vicar of the divinity, was obliged to preserve 10 . This can be deduced, for example, from the Castigos e documentos del rey don Sancho IV , a Castilian treatise intended for the education of the crown prince from the late thirteenth century, in which the regalia insignia of 'vn rey muy noble' are described, among which is included an orb that, note well, is referred to as 'manzana':",

This researcher notes that the cross on the orb of King Martin I the Humane (1396-1410) is very different from the crosses of Sobrarbe that crown the orbs of his predecessors, whereby 'this detail raises the question of whether the cross, almost fleur-de-lysed rather than pattée, could offer the image of a new piece from the royal treasury destined to replace the one that had belonged to Peter the Ceremonious' 23 . Another detail from the Genealogy of Poblet, specifically the pentimento showing that the illuminator, once having completed the portrait of the Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer IV, erased the florons from his headpiece to thereby transform a royal crown into a comital one (into a richly decorated garland or diadem) 24 , seems to confirm the fidelity of this work in the representation of insignia, which, consequently, reaffirms the idea that the differences in the orbs did not respond to the artist's imagination, but to a copy of reality. It is interesting to note, moreover, that the Count of Barcelona appears with a cruciferous orb in his left hand, which would be interpreted in this case as a symbol of sovereignty, that is, not as a royal insignia, since it was not corrected as the royal crown was.",

In its formal conception it bears a very close relationship to medieval cartographic sources, specifically to the schematic tripartite 'T-O' maps (Fig. 2). The 'T' is a stylised representation of the three water channels that separate the three continents then known: the left horizontal arm is the Tanais (River Don), the right is the Nile, and the vertical stem is the Mediterranean Sea 27; the 'O' is the surrounding ocean that embraces the earth, as if it were a river. Asia is located in the upper half and in the lower half, Europe on the left and Africa on the right. These maps are oriented in the literal sense of the word, that is, the East is placed at the top, in the preeminent position according to medieval Christian spatial hierarchy. The prominence accorded to this continent is due to the fact that it is where the sun rises—a celestial body intimately associated with the divinity 28—and where the earthly paradise is found, as recorded in Genesis (II, 8) and as many medieval maps show 29. Although the conception of the tripartite world and these natural divisions of the three continents have their origin in Antiquity 30, these geographical notions were assimilated in the Middle Ages with the biblical account of the division of the world among the three sons of Noah—Shem, Japheth, and Ham—after the universal flood 31. For this reason, many of these maps allude textually and graphically to this distribution of lands and to those who were their heirs 32.",

Among the many existing examples in medieval figurative arts, we shall highlight two of them that are significant for their varied approaches: Emperor Augustus appears portrayed in a manuscript of the Liber floridus of Lambert of Saint-Omer (ca. 1250-1275) with a T-O orb in his left hand (Fig. 2), where, as on maps, the names of the three continents are indicated (Asia, Europa, and Affrica) 34 . Likewise, the Christ Child appears with a T-O orb on the shoulders of Saint Christopher in the altarpiece of this saint made in the 14th century 35 . In this case, the tripartition of the world evokes air (the sky with the sun, moon, and stars), water (fish), and earth (castles), something we also frequently find in medieval maps, for example, in the representation of the mappamundi of Darius's tomb in the Alexander in",

Many other medieval images of the tripartite world managed to simulate the spherical sense of the Earth, giving the 'T' a three-dimensional form. This occurs in the image of the English poet John Gower (ca. 1330-1408) shooting arrows at a sphere in a manuscript of his Vox Clamantis (Voice of the Prophet) from 1399-1408 38 : again the tripartite sphere embodies three of the natural elements (air, earth and water). This same sphericity appears in some illustrated orbs, especially from the fifteenth century onwards and with the development of Flemish painting. The oil technique allowed the representation through a system of glazes of a crystalline sphere, which in turn, allowed the rear part of the three-dimensional 'T' to show through. Thus it appears, for example, in the Salvator mundi (ca. 1500-1510) by the Flemish painter Quentin Massys 39 or, within the Hispano-Flemish sphere, in the Salvador by Pedro Berruguete (ca. 1490) 40 (Fig. 3).",

The universe was conceived as spherical, finite, and geocentric. The Earth, composed of the material substances earth, water, air, and fire, was located at the centre and around it, eight homocentric spheres with the known planets (including the sun and the moon) and the fixed stars, made of a crystalline and transparent substance, rotated thanks to the Primum mobile or First Mover 41 (Fig. 1). This crystalline universe is thus what the aforementioned paintings reproduce in the hands of the divinity. And while on the spherical crystal of Massys typically Flemish buildings and towers are reflected, which perhaps evoke the inhabited world or the place where this work was made 42, Berruguete's sphere additionally reveals another sphere inside it, upon which schematic images of cities rise, and which we could identify with the Earth 43.",

This inversion of the 'T' brought with it a loss of the original cartographic resonance of the 'T-O' maps.

But the connections of this insignia with geography and cartography do not disappear, but rather materialise in another model of orb, which we will call the 'geographic orb', because in its formal conception a more realistic drawing of the world takes precedence. Behind this geographic realism lie the cartographic advances that took place in Florence in the fifteenth century and that determined the end of",

On the one hand, the recovery in the West of the Geografía of Claudius Ptolemy (ca. 100-ca. 170), which arrived in Florence at the end of the fourteenth century among the manuscripts brought from Constantinople by Manuel Chrysoloras, and translated into Latin by him and by Jacopo Angeli (1406-1409) 45 . The great popularity achieved by this Ptolemaic work lies in the fact that it explained, for the first time in a scientific manner, how to project a sphere onto a flat surface and, consequently, how to make maps. Paradoxically, Ptolemy's Geografía ended up being useful not only for transferring the sphere to the plane, but also for recreating the three-dimensional image of the world on a two-dimensional support 46 , ultimately, for the subject that concerns us here: the representation of the Earth on illustrated pommels or orbs. In the artistic concern to graphically show the so-called 'third projection', where the Greek geographer asks 'in what way can the visible hemisphere of the Earth contained under an armillary sphere be represented on a plane' (Book 7, chap. 6) 47 , an anonymous author incorporated between 1503-1516 an image that resolved this question in a Florentine manuscript of Ptolemy's Geografía, made around 1470 48 (Fig. 4): on the sphere of the Earth a Ptolemaic mappamundi is projected, in which only the known world is mapped (the rest remains blank) 49 . This artistic solution to the third projection was only surpassed in 1525 by Albrecht Dürer, author of the corresponding image in the printed edition of Willibald Pirckheimer, made in Strasbourg in 1525 50 . In his engraving, Dürer adhered more closely to the laws of perspective by diminishing the distance between the meridians as their distance from the viewer's eye increased, thus creating the artifice of a three-dimensional globe.",

Also similar is the orb with which a figure, perhaps Claudius Ptolemy himself, appears portrayed by Raphael Sanzio in The School of Athens (1509-1512) in the Stanza della Segnatura of the Vatican Palaces.
