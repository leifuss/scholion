Rōshn, Mardānfarrokh refers several times to the work of Rōshn (de Menasce 1945, 10.50-8).
West (1885, 169 no. 4) identifies this Rōshn with the commentator Rōshn, who is mentioned
for example in Shayest-ne-shayest and Pahlavi Videvdad. He is mentioned 10 times in Pahlavi
Vīdēvdād (Cantera 2004, 208), where at one time he is in dispute with Abarag, the last com-
mentator from the school of Adurfarrbay-Narsē (Adurfarrbay-Narsē, Sōshans, Abarag). He pays
special attention to those passages of the Denkard that are composed by Adurfarrbay and of
Adurbād i Jäwandān (or Adurbād i Jawandad or Ādarpadiiäwandą; see de Menasce 1945; 4.106-7,
9.1-3, 10.50-8, 1.38). Adurbād i Jäwandan was probably the teacher (bun-spas, West 1885, 162;
de Menasce 1945, 109) of Adurfarrbay (de Menasce 1945, 9.1-3) and perhaps also the author of
the lost books Denkard 1 and 2 (West 1885, 138-9, no. 9). It seems that Mardanfarrokh did not
belong to the very dense and close circle of Persian high priests. Early wanderings (de Menasce
1945, 1.36-7, 10.43-49; compare the wanderings of the sage (danag) in Menog i Khrad 1.34-60)
led him, as he says, "to the borders of many countries and seas" (de Menasce 1945, 1.37; see
also 10.47). Perhaps a Manichaean with intimate knowledge of Manichaeism (a sharp polemic
against Mani ["Mānāe"] is found in Shkand Gumānīg Wizār 1.59-60), at this time he found his
"salvation" (de Menasce 1945, 1.54, 10.58) especially in Zoroastrian scriptures but above all in
the texts of Adurbād i Jawandan and Adurfarrbay i Farrokhzādān. His intellectually important
book, which was widespread in copies in Pazand and in a Sanskrit translation in India was "not
made and arranged for the wise and experienced men, but for pupils and novices" (de Menasce
1945, 1.40). Parts of Mardanfarrokh's text also survived in an older Pahlavi version (West 1885,
xxviii; de Menasce 1945, 159; see also Jâmâsp-Âsânâ and West 1887, xxvii, xxxvii-xxxviii;
Cereti 2014). Mardanfarrokh completed what began in Adurfarrbay's work. Denkard 3 and
Shkand Gumānīg Wizar are connected in two important points, the development of polemical/
demarcating ideas that are the results of reflection and discussion on non-Zoroastrian positions
based on logical arguments and the development of a philosophical terminology and system.
I.16.5 What can we know about Zoroastrian scholarship
before the 3rd/9th century?
It is difficult, if not impossible, to provide trustworthy information about the centuries prece-
ding Adurfarrbay, because we need to rely on material of uncertain dates. One such source is
the previously mentioned Shkand Gumanīg Wizar. It indicates that Adurfarrbay's (supposed)
teacher, Adurbād i Jawandān, had already worked with some philosophical concepts known
from Denkard 3. Another source attributed some of the terms in the transmission report Den-
kard 4 to Aristotelian influence. The latter was written in the time of Khōsraw I (on the age
of the text manuscript B 322.4ff., see Bartholomae 1920, 9, no. 2 and Cantera 2004, 106; for
the text see Zaehner 1955, 7-9, 31-4 and Cantera 2004, 110-11). Aristotelian influence is also
apparent in the terms nerōg ī mēnōyig/paydagihēnīdārīh gētīyig (Sanjana 1874-1928, 4.25,
manuscript B 323, 11-14), which seem to combine the Zoroastrian distinction of menōg/getīg
"non-material"/"material" with the potential/actual distinction.
The relation of the two recensions of the Bundahishn, that is the Greater Bundahishn (Iranian
Bundahishn) and the Indian Bundahishn, is methodologically important. Those parts of the Greater
Bundahishn, which stem from the priestly editor Farrbay (see the earlier discussion), share phil-
osophical elements known from Denkard 3. In the Indian Bundahishn, however, these elements
are missing. That gives rise to the assumption that parts of the transmitted Pahlavi materials were
reworked according to the categories of Adurfarrbay's 'philosophical theology'. Hence, it is likely
that at least some important Pahlavi texts are neither simply "final versions of texts which evolved
in oral transmission over long periods of time" (Kreyenbroek 2002, 42-3) nor the late product
