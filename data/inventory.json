    "abstract": "The decisive victory of the Arabs over the Iranians put an end to Zoroastrian Iran and brought it into the Arab Caliphate in 651. However, the \"indirect meeting\" of Islam and Zoroastrianism had taken place centuries before through the impact of Zoroaster's teaching on Judaism, Christianity, and the religion of the Muslims. Although the \"direct encounter\" resulted in the virtual disappearance of Zoroastrianism from Iran, it nonetheless brought about a certain synthesis of the two spiritual traditions--most visible in two classical schools of Islamic thought: the mystical trend of Sufism and the Illuminationism of Ishrāqism. Whether Zoroastrianism is still culturally alive, and what its future prospects may be are discussed here.",

    "abstract": "The Portuguese and the Spanish carried over the medieval crusading spirit of the Reconquista in their discoveries of the new route to India and the New World respectively. The Portuguese aimed at taking Mecca with the hope of exchanging it for Jerusalem. They also established links with the king of Ethiopia, identifying him as the Prester John. And finally they tightened the economic stranglehold of the Mamlūk empire. The response to this initiative came, however, from the Ottoman State, which first incorporated the Mamlūk territories in the Middle East within its empire, then challenged the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean and the Spanish in the Mediterranean. The Ottomans, at the peak of their power in the sixteenth century, possessed the required naval strength and the types of ships needed for journeys of exploration. Having prepared the map of the New World, based on a map of Columbus, with America clearly marked as their administrative province, \"Vilayet Antilia,\" they were set to pursue their enemies across the Atlantic. The Saʿdian regime of Morocco, however, prevented their access to the Atlantic. Revolts on the European, Persian, and South Arabian fronts of the empire further weakened the Ottomans. Since in the age of the East India companies the crusading motivation of the Spanish and the Portuguese had been much diluted, the counter-crusading desire of the Ottomans also no longer needed to extend itself to encompass America.",

One of these teachers was Sa'id al-Andalusi, who in 1068 wrote Kitab Tabaqat al-'Umam, or \"Book of the Categories of Nations,\" which recorded the contributions to science of all known nations. Today, it is one of few surviving medieval Spanish Muslim texts, and this is its first English translation.Science ('ulum), as used by Sa'id and other scholars of that period, is a broad term covering virtually all aspects of human knowledge. After initial discussions of the categories of nations that did or did not cultivate science, Sa'id details the specific contribution of nine nations or peoples-India, Persia, Chaldea, Greece, Rome, Egypt, the Arab Orient, al-Andalus, and the Hebrews. He includes the names of many individual scientists and scholars and describes their various contributions to knowledge, making his book a significant work of reference as well as history.",

It was the only copy known to the editors of the ‘Ajā’ib al-aqālīm al-sab‘ah , Mžik and LeStrange, who were unaware of Or. 10975. This copy contains the following diagrams and illustrations: Table of the latitudes of the seven climes (جدول عرض الأقاليم; f. 4r); Template for the construction of a world map, with graduated borders and the climes labelled (f. 4v); Template for the plotting of cities and way stations on a map (f. 5r); Twenty-five tables containing the names of cities with their latitudes and longitudes, arranged by clime (ff. 6r-9v); Illustration of the Citidel of Sārūs ibn Kandamān (قلعة ساروس ابن كندمان), apparently not drawn by a professional illustrator, but by the scribe who added the rubricated headings and overlinings on ff. 2v-10r. The text is followed by a poem of eight lines (f. 68v) entitled The Great Reckoning of Praise, a Poem Written Above the Head of the Prophet (حساب الحمد الكبير قصيدة مكتوبة فوق رأس النبي), copied, according to a marginal note, by Murād ibn al-Ḥāj (مراد ابن الحاج). Begins (f. 2v, lines 2-4): إن أحسن ما افتتح به الكلام في كل رغبة ورهبة وحاجة حمد الله تعالى الحمد لله مفلج ومدحض الباطل وما حقه الذي اختار لنفسه الإسلام دينًا فأمر به وحاطه فوكّل بحفظه وضمن أظهاره على الدين كله ... Ends (ff. 67r, line 11-67v, line 3): ... فإذا تكاملت العيون والأنهار وصحّت من أوائلها وجرت إلى أواخر مصبّاتها وتفرّع بعضها من بعض وصبّ بعضها إلى بعض فقد استتممت عملها واحتجت بعد ذلك إلى أن تبتدئ بعمل صور المدن العظام المشهورة وكيف هيئة كل مدينة منها وإخبارها وصفتها ونعتها وشربها وانحراف قبلتها حتى تأتي على جميع مدن الأرض وبالله نستعين وإن أردت أن تكتب بعد صورة كل مدينة خبرها فاكتبه إلى جنبها أو حولها فإنه أحسن ما يكون وأظرفه Colophon Section at the end of a manuscript text. (f. 67v, lines 4-8): نقلت من نسخة نقلت من نسخة نقلت من نسخة صحيحة ذكر ابن الوراق أنها بخط ابن البهلول الذي أصلح كتاب ابن سرابيون وقوبل بها نسخة أخرى فكانت فيها زيادة وهي المواضع التي يذكر فيها حدود البلدان وقد كتبناها بعد هذا الموضع وكتب في منتصف ربيع الأول من سنة تسع وسبعمائة الهلالية والحمد لله رب العالمين وصلوته على سيدنا محمد النبي وآله الطاهرين وصحبه وسلامة"

    "abstract": "A discussion of European understanding of the physical world from the 9th century to the 15th, ranging from astronomy to zoology - and refuting the more recent notion that the world was thought flat. What were the ideas held by medieval man concerning the size and shape of the earth? How many planets were there, and of what material was the universe constructed? What was the relationship between the sky and Heaven? How were snow, thunderstorms and comets explained? In this fascinating book Dr Simek shows that though nature was thought to be permeated by the will of God, there were numerous explanations for unknown phenomena, from the simple theories of the early middle ages to the more sophisticated ideas of the centres of learned scholasticism in Paris and Oxford. He presents a cross-section of the medieval knowledge of the physical world as deliberated and discussed byauthors from the 9th to the 15th centuries. He touches on fields as diverse as astronomy, geography, physics, botany and chemistry, and shows how medieval knowledge combined `scientific' explanations with others from popular mythology and folklore.

    "abstract": "The widespread appearance of critical comments in Islamic literature about teachings that were developed in the field of philosophy and about the practice of philosophy in general led many Western historians of the past to conclude that philosophy was a marginal phenomenon in Islam and its practitioners considered heretics. Al-Ghazālī’s (d. 505/1111) condemnation of three teachings held by the so-called falāsifa – here referring to Avicenna and his followers – was often seen as a watershed for the philosophical movement in Islam that led to its demise and subsequent disappearance. A close reading of the sources, however, leads to more nuanced conclusions. Philosophy did not decline or disappear after Al-Ghazālī but was soon practiced by religious scholars. While rejecting some positions of the falāsifa, Al-Ghazālī himself endorsed others and his legal condemnation of philosophers as apostates from Islam was hardly ever followed. Western and mostly Christian categories of religious heterodoxy and deviation, such as “heretic,” do not match up with the Islamic vocabulary of religious heterodoxy and should be avoided.",

First, short- or long-term observations were undertaken by individual scholars or within a family or workshop context. Second, observations were carried out by larger groups of scholars, craftsmen and administrators within the context of a long-term program, often including the construction of an observatory with specialized buildings and fixed instruments with large scales. Long-term group activities were enabled by substantive patronage, normally by a ruler but occasionally also by a vizier or an affiliated prince. Many of the individual observation projects and all group projects led to the compilation of a set of astronomical and astrological tables called a zīj (pl. zijes). But individual projects also occurred on a more limited scale of purpose and duration. Examining currently published research results yielded the remarkable insight that many more long-term observation projects have taken place than previously thought, often as individual efforts.",

It begins with Ibn al-Haytham’s reflections on the configuration of the universe and his criticisms of Ptolemy’s models due to their violation of major principles of Aristotelian physics; these provided topics and orientation for later scholars. It then argues that with al-Kharaqī, a new genre specifically dedicated to the discussion of physical models emerged, leading to the development of the new models created at Maragha. Al-Tūsī’s new model for the superior planets is described as a concrete example. The chapter then identifies the Marāgha School’s most important known successors up to the 12th/17th century and briefly reviews the completely different approach that developed in Andalusia.",

It acknowledges literary elegance as a second criterion according to which geographical works can be classified and its intentional renunciation as a main rupture in the history of geography.

    "abstract": "This Variorum volume reprints ten papers on contextual elements of the so-called ancient sciences in Islamicate societies between the thirteenth and the seventeenth centuries. They address four major themes: the ancient sciences in educational institutions; courtly patronage of science; the role of the astral and other sciences in the Mamluk sultanate; and narratives about knowledge.\nThe main arguments are directed against the then dominant historiographical claims about the exclusion of the ancient sciences from the madrasa and cognate educational institutes, the suppression of philosophy and other ancient sciences in Damascus after 1229, the limited role of the new experts for timekeeping in the educational and professional exercise of this science, and the marginal impact of astrology under Mamluk rule. It is shown that the muwaqqits (timekeepers) were important teachers at madrasas and Sufi convents, that Mamluk officers sought out astrologers for counselling and that narratives about knowledge reveal important information about scholarly debates and beliefs. Colophons and dedications are used to prove that courtly patronage for the ancient sciences continued uninterrupted until the end of the seventeenth century. Furthermore, these papers refute the idea of a continued and strong conflict between the ancient and modern sciences, showing rather shifting alliances between various of them and their regrouping in the classifications of the entire disciplinary edifice.\nThese papers are suited for graduate teaching in the history of science and the intellectual, cultural and social history of the Middle East and for all readers interested in the study of the contexts of the sciences.",

The famous geographer and cartographer Al-Idrisi (IX/X., died in 903/913.) has lived on the court of Norman king Roger II of Sicily, and after his death on the court of his son William I on Sicily, where he obtained the data from European and Arabic geographers. On the basis of this data he wrote a work known entitled Roger’s book. Besides this important work he made a celestial globe and a map of the world in the shape of a silver disk. The lines that marked the borders of seven regions of the inhabited world were engraved on this disk. The Arabs had excellent knowledge of Greek astronomy and accepted their division of the world in seven climatic zones.",

Here, in quirky, often breathless style, Pliny lays the foundation of a hugely influential encyclopedia with coverage of the universe, stars, planets and moon, followed by earth's climate and then its physical and human geography. From Rome as ruling centerpoint, Pliny surveys the known world and its countless peoples in a vast arc from the Atlantic to Sri Lanka, embracing the Danube, Euphrates and Nile lands, Atlas and Caucasus mountains, Germany, Africa, Arabia, India. Passages from later books further illustrating his geographical grasp are appended, on topics as varied as wine, water, trees, birds and fish. Throughout, Pliny's frank expression of strong opinions about religion, distorted human values, abuse of the environment (and more) reveal uncannily modern preoccupations. His work remained an inspirational resource through the Renaissance, and still fascinates today.",

The second charts the rise of Islam and the emergence of the Islamic political order under the Umayyad and the Abbasid caliphs of the seventh, eighth and ninth centuries, followed by the dissolution of the empire in the tenth and eleventh. 'Regionalism', the overlapping histories of the empire's provinces, is the focus of Part Three, while Part Four provides a cutting-edge discussion of the sources and controversies of early Islamic history, including a survey of numismatics, archaeology and material culture.",

Dimitri Gutas draws upon the preceding historical and philological scholarship in Greco-Arabic studies and the study of medieval translations of secular Greek works into Arabic and analyses the social and historical reasons for this phenomenon.Dimitri Gutas provides a stimulating, erudite and well-documented survey of this key movement in the transmission of ancient Greek culture to the Middle Ages.",

    "abstract": "In the medieval world, geographical knowledge was influenced by religious ideas and beliefs. Whereas this point is well analysed for the Latin-Christian world, the religious character of the Arabic-Islamic geographic tradition has not yet been scrutinised in detail. This volume addresses this desideratum and combines case studies from both traditions of geographic thinking. The contributions comprise in-depth analyses of individual geographical works as for example those of al-Idrisi or Lambert of Saint-Omer, different forms of presenting geographical knowledge such as TO-diagrams or globes as well as performative aspects of studying and meditating geographical knowledge. Focussing on texts as well as on maps, the contributions open up a comparative perspective on how religious knowledge influenced the way the world and its geography were perceived and described int the medieval world.",

      "\"This learned and engaging study casts new light on the nature of religion in pre-Islamic Iran and on the persistence of Iranian religious beliefs both outside and inside Islam after the Arab conquest\"-- \"Patricia Crone's latest book is about the Iranian response to the Muslim penetration of the Iranian countryside, the revolts subsequently triggered there, and the religious communities that these revolts revealed. The book also describes a complex of religious ideas that, however varied in space and unstable over time, has demonstrated a remarkable persistence in Iran across a period of two millennia. The central thesis is that this complex of ideas has been endemic to the mountain population of Iran and occasionally become epidemic with major consequences for the country, most strikingly in the revolts examined here, and in the rise of the Safavids who imposed Shi'ism on Iran. This learned and engaging book by one of the most influential scholars of early Islamic history casts entirely new light on the nature of religion in pre-Islamic Iran, and on the persistence of Iranian religious beliefs both outside and inside Islam after the Arab conquest\"--"

    "abstract": "The Epistles of the Brethren of Purity' is an encyclopedic compendium, probably composed in tenth-century Iraq by a society of adepts with Platonic, Pythagorean, and Shi'i tendencies. Its 52 sections ('epistles') are divided into four parts (Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Sciences of the Soul and Intellect, and Theology). The current volume provides an edition, translation, and notes to Epistle 3 ('On Astronomia'), which forms one of the 14 sections on Mathematics. The content is a mixture of elementary astronomy and astrology, but it is not a beginner's textbook. Rather, the purpose is to use examples from those disciplines to provide spiritual, moral, and soteriological guidance. Thus the Epistle uses the argument from design to show the necessity for a Creator who made the harmonious universe; this wondrous design is then employed by the authors as a model, providing humans with a paradigm for proper ethical, political, and even economic conduct; and the study of Astronomia helps the soul achieve ultimate happiness as it seeks to throw off the shackles of this mundane world and oppressive body in favour of the purity of the celestial realm.0Although by no means typical of Islamic astronomical literature, Epistle 3 of the Brethren of Purity gives a window into a fascinating and intriguing group operating during the early period of Islam who sought to continue and adopt one of the esoteric strands of Hellenistic philosophy within an Islamic context, meshing astronomy, astrology, Platonic-Pythagorean philosophy, Quranic and Biblical quotations, and anecdotes from the lives of the Abrahamic prophets",

However, to date, no single study has done justice to the full spectrum of traditions of thinking about the topic in Islamic history. The Muslim hell, in particular, remains a little studied subject. This book, which is based on a wide array of carefully selected Arabic and Persian texts, covers not only the theological and exegetical but also the philosophical, mystical, topographical, architectural and ritual aspects of the Muslim belief in paradise and hell, in both the Sunni and the Shiʿi world. By examining a broad range of sources related to the afterlife, Christian Lange shows that Muslim religious literature, against transcendentalist assumptions to the contrary, often pictures the boundary between this world and the otherworld as being remarkably thin, or even permeable",

    "abstract": "\"Cihānnümā is the summa of Ottoman geography and one of the axial texts of Islamic intellectual history. Kātib Çelebi (d. 1657) sought to combine the Islamic geographical tradition with the new European discoveries, atlases and surveys. His cosmography included a comprehensive description of the regions of the world, extending westward from Japan and as far as the eastern Ottoman provinces. Ebū Bekr b. Behrām ed-Dimaşḳī(d. 1691) continued with a survey of the Arab countries and the remaining Ottoman provinces of Anatolia. İbrāhīm Müteferriḳa combined the two, with additional notes and maps of his own, in one of the earliest Ottoman printed books, Kitāb-ı Cihānnümā (1732). Our translation includes the entire text of Müteferriḳa's edition, distinguishing clearly between the contributions of the three authors. Based on Kātib Çelebi's original manuscript we have made hundreds of corrections to Müteferriḳa's text. Additional corrections are based on comparison with Kātib Çelebi's Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Latin and Italian sources\"--",

The most important of the works are the History ( Ta’rikh) and his Geography ( Kitab al-buldan). The works also contains a new translation of al-Ya`qubī’s political essay ( Mushakalat al-nas) and a set of fragmentary texts drawn from other Arabic medieval works. Al-Ya`qūbī’s writings are among the earliest surviving Arabic-language works of the Islamic period, and thus offer an invaluable body of evidence on patterns of early Islamic history, social and economic organization, and cultural production. \n\nContributors: Laila Asser, Paul Cobb, Lawrence I.

    "abstract": "The astrological poem (Carmen Astrologicum) of Dorotheus of Sidon (1st Century AD) played a key role in later Persian, Arabic, and Latin astrology, forming the basis of many works on nativities, inceptions or elections, and questions (\"horary\"), such as the Book of Aristotle, al-Rijāl's Book of the Skilled, and the books of Sahl b. Bishr. After being translated into Persian in the 3rd Century, it was later put into an Arabic edition by the famous astrologer 'Umar al-Tabarī.This new English translation of al-Tabarī explains many special features of Dorotheus's work, including chart dating, the use of triplicity lords, transits and profections, ascensional times, and more. With numerous footnotes, extra diagrams, and the Greek prose Excerpts (translated by Eduardo Gramaglia), it supersedes the 1976 edition by Pingree. This essential work for traditional astrologers and will repay close study.",

    "abstract": "The story of Dhu al-Qarnayn (in Arabic ذو القرنين, literally \"The Two-Horned One\"; also transliterated as Zul-Qarnain or Zulqarnain), is mentioned in Surah al-Kahf of the Quran.It has long been recognised in modern scholarship that the story of Dhu al-Qarnayn has strong similarities with the Syriac Legend of Alexander the Great. According to this legend, Alexander travelled to the ends of the world then built a wall in the Caucasus mountains to keep Gog and Magog out of civilized lands (the latter element is found several centuries earlier in the works of Flavius Josephus). Several argue that the form of this narrative in the Syriac Alexander Legend (known as the Neṣḥānā) dates to between 629 and 636 CE and so is not the source for the Qur'anic narrative based on the view held by many Western and Muslim scholars that Surah 18 belongs to the second Meccan Period (615–619). The Syriac Legend of Alexander has however received a range of dates by different scholars, from a latest date of 630 (close to Muhammad's death) to an earlier version inferred to have existed in the 6th century CE. Sidney Griffith argues that the simple storyline found in the Syriac Alexander Legend (and the slightly later metrical homily or Alexander poem) \"would most likely have been current orally well before the composition of either of the Syriac texts in writing\" and it is possible that it was this orally circulating version of the account which was recollected in the Islamic milieu. The majority of modern researchers of the Qur'an as well as Islamic commentators identify Dhu al-Qarnayn as Alexander the Great.",

    "abstract": "This volume contains two texts that crossed the Mediterranean in Late Antiquity. The Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius was one of the first works composed in response to the Arab invasions and the establishment of the Muslim empire in the seventh century. In a matter of decades, it was translated from its original Syriac into Greek and from Greek into Latin. (Both the Greek and Latin texts are presented here.) The Apocalypse enjoyed immense popularity throughout the Middle Ages, informing expectations of the end of the world, responses to strange and exotic invaders like the Mongols and Turks, and even the legendary versions of the life of Alexander the Great. An Alexandrian World Chronicle (Excerpta Latina Barbari) was considered important by no less a humanist than Joseph Scaliger. He recognized it as a representative of an early stage in the Christian chronicle tradition that would dominate medieval historiography. The original Greek text may have been a diplomatic gift from the court of Justinian to a potential ally among Frankish royalty, translated two centuries later by the Franks themselves in their efforts to convert the pagan Saxons. In addition to presenting a universal chronicle with a comprehensive ethnography and geography, the Excerpta offer a Euhemeristic narrative of the gods and another account of Alexander.",

The attribution of the work to Aristotle helped the text to become an influential source of Neoplatonic ideas in the Arabic-speaking world. But the Arabic Plotinus materials are important not only as a conduit for Plotinus’ ideas; they also differ on numerous points from their ultimate source. Thus the Theology, along with other texts derived from the Arabic version of Plotinus, in fact constitute an interpretation of Plotinus’ thought, and not just a translation. The Theology in turn becomes the chief text conveying Plotinian ideas to the Arabic-speaking tradition.",

    "abstract": "The 'Jami' Zij' ('Comprehensive Zij') was a highly popular Arabic astronomical handbook with tables written by the Iranian astronomer Kushyar ibn Labban al-Jili around the year 1000. It belonged to an important category of works, modelled after Ptolemy?s 'Almagest' and 'Handy Tables', that allowed the practising astronomer/astrologer to carry out all necessary calculations of arcs on the heavenly sphere and planetary positions, and ultimately to cast horoscopes. Around one hundred such works are extant, but only very few have been edited, translated or studied in detail.0This book contains a full treatment of Book II of Kushyar's astronomical handbook centred around a critical edition of all the mathematical tables and their paratexts. It sets new standards for the edition of such tables by designing new types of apparatus entries for related variants in the tabular values. The introductory part describes the eight surviving manuscripts that transmit Kushyar's tables and establishes by a detailed survey that they represent at least three different versions of the 'Jami' Zij' that in all likelihood stem from Kushyar himself. An extensive commentary with mathematical analyses uncovers numerous new details of the methods by which the tables were computed, the astronomical parameter values on which they were based, the sources for the tables, and their influence on later 'zijes'. These results show how Kushyar, on the one hand, stayed firmly within the framework of the Ptolemaic tradition, but on the other introduced several types of innovations that later became common in Arabic and Persian astronomical handbooks",

A theoretical explanation of the \"Inhabited Quarter\" of the world, comparable to the ecumene, frames the world with classical concepts like the seven climes.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of geographical coordinates extracted from the Kennedy & Kennedy's book \"Geographical coordinates of localities from Islamic sources\" (1987), allows a renewed vision of mathematical geography in the medieval Muslim West (9th -16th centuries). We show that, contrary to what they themselves assert in their writings, all the ancient Arab geographers retain a \"zero meridian” rejected to the west of the Canary Islands (meridian of water). This meridian was inaccessible, so that in practice they use a conventional fixed meridian located in the Middle East (most likely Baghdad and/or Damascus). We show that al-Khwārizmī (9th century) played a founding role in the creation of this system and in partial correcting the erroneous data of Ptolemy. Subsequently, especially in the 10th and 11th centuries, some authors made further global and/or local improvements, but these were soon forgotten.",

We conclude with a summary of table transmission: from origins with the appropriation of traditions of astronomical tables taken from Greece and India, through the establishment of a Ptolemaic tradition in the 9th century and a uniquely Islamic expansion of methods and concepts starting in the 10th, to important sub-traditions in alAndalus and the Maghrib.",

Frederick Starr tells the fascinating but largely unknown story of Central Asia's medieval enlightenment through the eventful lives and astonishing accomplishments of its greatest minds--remarkable figures who built a bridge to the modern world. Because nearly all of these figures wrote in Arabic, they were long assumed to have been Arabs. In fact, they were from Central Asia--drawn from the Persianate and Turkic peoples of a region that today extends from Kazakhstan southward through Afghanistan, and from the easternmost province of Iran through Xinjiang, China. Lost Enlightenment recounts how, between the years 800 and 1200, Central Asia led the world in trade and economic development, the size and sophistication of its cities, the refinement of its arts, and, above all, in the advancement of knowledge in many fields. -- Publisher website",

    "abstract": "Two Islamic brass scientific instruments, each bearing a map of the world for finding the direction and distance to Mecca, have come to light since 1989. They both appear to date from Safavid Iran, possibly from the late seventeenth century. Each is a copy of a different earlier map of the same kind, and both these derive from a more elaborate prototype. They are the only known surviving Islamic world maps with localities properly marked on a competently drawn coordinate grid. Serious activity in mathematical cartography, including the preparation of detailed world maps, is known to have started in Baghdad in the ninth century, and it is likely that the highly sophisticated cartographic grids on the Safavid world maps were first developed several centuries before these two maps were made./ Depuis 1989, deux instruments scientifiques en lation, portant une mappemonde pour trouver la direction et la distance par rapport à la Mecque, ont été découverts. Ils semblent tous deux dater de l'Iran safavide, sans doute de la fin du dix-septième siècle. Chacune des mappemondes est une copie différente d'une carte similaire plus ancienne, et tous deux dérivent d'un prototype plus élaboré. Ce sont les seules mappemondes islamiques qui nous sont conservées, sur lesquelles les localités se trouvent convenablement inscrites sur un quadrillage tracé de façon compétente. Au neuvième siècle commença à Baghdad une importante activité en cartographie mathématique, qui incluait la préparation de mappemondes détaillées. Il est vraisemblable que le quadrillage cartographique sophistiqué des deux mappemondes safavides ait été conçu plusieurs siècles avant que ces deux cartes n'aient été fabriquées./ Seit 1989 wurden zwei aus Messing gefertigte islamische wissenschaftliche Instrumente entdeckt, die beide eine Weltkarte zeigen, mit der Richtung und Entfernung nach Mekka bestimmt werden können. Beide Karten stammen wahrscheinlich aus dem safawidischen Iran, möglicherweise aus dem späten 17. Jahrhundert. Jede der beiden Karten ist eine Kopie einer anderen, früheren Karte dieser Art und beide ursprüngliche Karten stammen von einem noch reichhaltiger ausgeführten Prototypen. Sie sind die einzigen uns erhaltenen islamischen Weltkarten, auf denen Orte auf einem fachkundig gezeichneten Koordinatennetz Korrekt eingetragen sind. Ernstzunehmende Aktivität auf dem Gebiet der mathematischen Kartographie, einschließlich der Anfertigung detaillierter Weltkarten, begann in Baghdad im 9. Jahrhundert, und es ist wahrscheinlich, daß die hochentwickelten kartographischen Netze auf den beiden safawidischen Weltkarten bereits einige Jahrhunderte vor der Entstehung dieser beiden Karten entwickelt wurden.",

It identifies the areas in which contacts and transmission clearly occurred, those where they clearly did not, and others where questions remain open. It also considers models that draw attention to shared knowledge and interests, rather than specific moments of transfer. The authors propose four major barriers that impeded transmission, and four areas which offer possibilities for further comparative research on medieval Christian European and Arabic-Islamic mapmaking and geographical culture.",

This contribution presents an up-to-date summary of what we know of al-Idrīsī and his magnum opus, and reconsiders his status as someone who combined Latin and Islamic traditions. Paying particular attention to his representation of al-Andalus, the north African coast, and the eastern Mediterranean, this chapter argues, firstly, that al-Idrīsī produced a geography overwhelmingly based in the Arabic-Islamic tradition, with minimal input from written Latin sources and, secondly, that a particular intention of the work was the promotion of the interests and image of Roger II, King of Sicily.",

    "abstract": "From the ninth century, some Arab authors mention the existence of a translation of Ptolemy’s Geography. As this translation is lost, the exact nature of the work escapes us. Was it a translation of the eight books of the Geography without maps, or were the maps themselves either “translated” into Arabic or redesigned? The statements of contemporaries on the subject of the Geography offer contradictory evidence. On the other hand, at the beginning of the third/ninth century an adaptation of Ptolemy was made by al-Khwārizmī for the caliph al-Maʿmūn, in the form of a book entitled Kitāb ṣūrat al-arḍ or Geography. If the toponyms of the Muslim world in this work are those of the ninth century, the territories situated beyond, in Africa and in Asia, display toponyms derived from Ptolemy, perhaps through the intermediary of a Syriac adaption (possibly in the form of a map). After the ninth century, almost all the citations in Arabic geographic texts that claim to come from Ptolemy’s Geography actually derive from al-Khwārizmī. Against this, a number of geographic co-ordinates preserved in astronomical or geographical tables, and several passages quoted by al-Bīrūnī, are manifestly taken from Ptolemy’s Geography, which shows that some parts of the Geography had been translated into Arabic and used independently, albeit we do not know the exact origins of these translations.",

    "abstract": "During the Middle Ages, a thriving center for learning and research was Muslim Spain, where students gathered to consult Arabic manuscripts of earlier scientific works and study with famous teachers. One of these teachers was Sa'id al-Andalusi, who in 1068 wrote Kitab Tabaqat al-'Umam, or \"Book of the Categories of Nations,\" which recorded the contributions to science of all known nations. Today, it is one of few surviving medieval Spanish Muslim texts, and this is its first English translation. Science ('ulum), as used by Sa'id and other scholars of that period, is a broad term covering virtually all aspects of human knowledge. After initial discussions of the categories of nations that did or did not cultivate science, Sa'id details the specific contribution of nine nations or peoples-India, Persia, Chaldea, Greece, Rome, Egypt, the Arab Orient, al-Andalus, and the Hebrews. He includes the names of many individual scientists and scholars and describes their various contributions to knowledge, making his book a significant work of reference as well as history.",

    "abstract": "Kitāb al-Kharāj (Book of taxation) is a classic text on fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), written by Abū Yusūf Yaʻqūb Ibrāhīm al-Anṣārī al-Kūfī (died 798; 182 A.H.) at the request of the Abbasid caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd (763 or 766-809). Abū Yusūf was the most famous student of Abū Ḥanīfa and along with his illustrious teacher is considered one of the founders of the Ḥanafī school of law. In the introduction to the book, Abū Yusūf describes how the caliph asked him to write a work treating the collection of al-kharāj (the tax collected from non-Muslims), al-ʻushūr (a tithe payable by Muslims), al-ṣadaqāt (alms), and related matters requiring attention and action. Hārūn al-Rashīd's expressed intent was to use the work to address the oppressed condition of his subjects and to improve their economic well-being. The work includes such chapter headings as \"A description of the land [subject to] tithing and al-kharaj, and of Arabs and non-Arabs and idolaters and the people of the book [i.e., Christians and Jews] and others.\" The work also contains a considerable amount of historical and geographical information on the early centuries of Islam. This can be seen, for example, in the account of the conquest of Byzantine and Sassanian lands contained in the chapter faṣl fī arḍ al-shām wa al-jazīra (Chapter on the land of Syria and Mesopotamia). This manuscript copy of Kitāb al-Kharāj was completed in Damascus, near the end of Rajab, 1144 A.H. (January 1732). The table of contents, which appears to have been scattered and reattached to the book with its folios out of sequence, was apparently written about a century later, on the Dhū al-Ḥijjah, 16, 1245 A.H. (June 1830), in Sarajevo (present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina). This work has been reprinted in multiple editions in modern times and has been translated from the original Arabic into English, Russian, and French. World Digital Library.",

    "abstract": "Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (Arabic: محمد بن موسى الخوارزمي; c. 780 – c. 850), or al-Khwarizmi, was a Persian polymath from Khwarazm, who produced vastly influential works in mathematics, astronomy, and geography. Around 820 CE, he was appointed as the astronomer and head of the library of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad.: 14 Al-Khwarizmi's popularizing treatise on algebra (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing, c. 813–833 CE: 171 ) presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations. One of his principal achievements in algebra was his demonstration of how to solve quadratic equations by completing the square, for which he provided geometric justifications.: 14  Because he was the first to treat algebra as an independent discipline and introduced the methods of \"reduction\" and \"balancing\" (the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation), he has been described as the father or founder of algebra. The term algebra itself comes from the title of his book (the word al-jabr meaning \"completion\" or \"rejoining\"). His name gave rise to the terms algorism and algorithm, the Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese terms algoritmo, and the Spanish guarismo and Portuguese algarismo, both meaning \"digit\".In the 12th century, Latin translations of his textbook on arithmetic (Algorithmo de Numero Indorum) which codified the various Indian numerals, introduced the decimal positional number system to the Western world. The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing, translated into Latin by Robert of Chester in 1145, was used until the sixteenth century as the principal mathematical text-book of European universities.In addition to his best-known works, he revised Ptolemy's Geography, listing the longitudes and latitudes of various cities and localities.: 9  He further produced a set of astronomical tables and wrote about calendaric works, as well as the astrolabe and the sundial. He also made important contributions to trigonometry, producing accurate sine and cosine tables, and the first table of tangents.",

    "abstract": "The Hudud al-&#39;Alam, written in AD 982 for a Prince of Guzganan (located in the North West of modern Afghanistan), is a geography covering the whole known world and one of the earliest works of Persian prose. It was designed to accompany a map and, though the product of cabinet scholarship rather than original observation, it preserves much material from earlier compositions which are lost and shows originality in its organization. A facsimile edition of the unique MS, which came to light in Bukhara in the late 19th century, was published in Russia in 1930 by Barthold but it was left to Minorsky to make the data widely accessible by his English translation and his extensive commentary, which analyses the work&#39;s position in the early Islamic geographical tradition and identifies and discusses the places mentioned in the light of a wealth of other information. V. Minorsky was a former Professor of Persian in the University of London and his other translations include Tadhkirat al-Muluk, A Manual of Safavid Administration in this series.",

Al-Qazwînî weiß, dass die Erde eine Kugel ist; er weiß von der Heilkraftder Pflanzen und vom Einfluss des Mondes auf das Wasser der Meere und das Befinden der Menschen. Dass er aber auch an Wahrsagerei glaubt und an die Existenz von Wassermännern, dass er die Fliegen lobt, weil sie angeblich das rohe Fleisch vor Fäulnis bewahren, darüber wird der heutige Leser schmunzeln- und doch immer wieder die Anschaulichkeit, die Geschlossenheit und den Reichtum dieser frühen Weltbeschreibung bewundern und vergleichend unseren Himmel und unsere Erde betrachten.",

Exploring the dazzling movements of the stars above, the strange minutiae of the minerals beneath the earth, and everything in between, Qazwīnī offered a captivating account of the cosmos. With fine paintings and leading science, Wonders and Rarities inspired generations as it traveled through madrasas and courts, unveiling the magical powers of nature. Yet after circulating for centuries, first in Arabic and Persian, then in Turkish and Urdu, Qazwīnī’s compendium eventually came to stand as a strange, if beautiful, emblem of medieval ignorance.Restoring Qazwīnī to his place as a herald of the rare and astonishing, Travis Zadeh dramatically revises the place of wonder in the history of Islamic philosophy, science, and literature. From the Mongol conquests to the rise of European imperialism and Islamic reform, Zadeh shows, wonder provided an enduring way to conceive of the world—at once constituting an affective reaction, an aesthetic stance, a performance of piety, and a cognitive state. Yet through the course of colonial modernity, Qazwīnī’s universe of marvels helped advance the notion that Muslims lived in a timeless world of superstition and enchantment, unaware of the western hemisphere or the earth’s rotation around the sun.Recovering Qazwīnī’s ideas and his reception, Zadeh invites us into a forgotten world of thought, where wonder mastered the senses through the power of reason and the pleasure of contemplation.",

The most important of the works are the History ( Ta’rikh) and his Geography ( Kitab al-buldan). The works also contains a new translation of al-Ya`qubī’s political essay ( Mushakalat al-nas) and a set of fragmentary texts drawn from other Arabic medieval works. Al-Ya`qūbī’s writings are among the earliest surviving Arabic-language works of the Islamic period, and thus offer an invaluable body of evidence on patterns of early Islamic history, social and economic organization, and cultural production. \n\nContributors: Laila Asser, Paul Cobb, Lawrence I.

The earliest extant editions claim to be based on a 9th-century Arabic translation of a Syriac translation of the lost Greek original. It is a pseudo-Aristotelian work. Modern scholarship finds it likely to have been written in the 10th century in Arabic. Translated into Latin in the mid-12th century, it was influential among European intellectuals during the High Middle Ages.",

This role is already alluded to in Zoroastrian scripture (e.g. Yasht 19, Vendidad 2), where the figure appears as Yima kshaeta \"radiant Yima\" (Avestan: 𐬫𐬌𐬨𐬀 𐬑𐬱𐬀𐬉𐬙𐬀, romanized: Yima xšaēta) and from which the name 'Jamshid' is derived.\nBoth Jam and Jamshid remain common Iranian and Zoroastrian male names that are also popular in surrounding areas of Iran such as Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Edward FitzGerald transliterated the name as Jamshyd. In the eastern regions of Greater Iran, and by the Zoroastrians of the Indian subcontinent it is rendered as Jamshed.",

    "abstract": "The Cup of Jamshid (Persian: جام جم, jām-e Jam) is a cup of divination, which in Persian mythology was long possessed by the rulers of ancient Greater Iran. Its name is associated with Jamshid (Jam in New Persian), a mythological figure of Greater Iranian culture and tradition. The cup has also been called Jam-e Jahan nama, Jam-e Jahan Ara, Jam-e Giti nama, and Jam-e Kei-khosrow. The latter refers to Kaei Husravah in the Avesta, and Sushrava in the Vedas.\nThe cup has been the subject of many Persian poems and stories. Many authors ascribed the success of the Persian Empire to the possession of this artifact. It appears extensively in Persian literature.\nThe cup (\"Jām\") was said to be filled with an elixir of immortality and was used in scrying. As mentioned by Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda, it was believed that all seven heavens of the universe could be observed by looking into it (از هفت فلک در او مشاهده و معاینه کردی). It was believed to have been discovered in Persepolis in ancient times. The whole world was said to be reflected in it, and divinations within the cup were said to reveal deep truths. Sometimes, especially in popular depictions such as The Heroic Legend of Arslan, the cup has been visualized as a crystal ball. Helen Zimmern's English translation of the Shahnameh uses the term \"crystal globe\".\nThe seven-ringed Cupp of Jamshid is spoken of in the classic poem Rubaiyat by the 11th century Persian Omar Khayyam. See the 5th verse in the 5th translation by Edward Fitzgerald:Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose, And Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one knows; But still the Vine her ancient Ruby yields, And still a Garden by the Water blows.\nIt also finds mention in the Sawāneḥ, authored by Persian Sufi mystic Ahmad Ghazali:As long as the world-displaying goblet is in my hand, the wheel of heaven on high lowers itself before me / As long as the Kaʿba of non-being is the qebla of my being, the most sober man in the world is intoxicated by me.In 20th century literature, the cup was mentioned in poetry of South Asian poet, philosopher, and one of the founder fathers of Pakistan, Allama Muhammad Iqbal in his poem Tasveer E Dard (English: The Portrait of Anguish).Urdu(romanized): \"Agar Dekha Bhi Uss Ne Sare Aalam Ko To Kya Dekha? Nazar Ayi Na Kuch Apni Haqiqat Jaam Se Jam Ko\".\nEnglish(translated): Even if he viewed the whole world, what did he see? Jam could not see his own reality in the wine cup",

But how can astrology be reconciled with medicine? During the Golden Age of Islam, some Arabic astrologers justified the belief in astral influences by composing a theory that explains 'scientifically' why the stars above had such a strong influence on the sublunary world and how their influence could be utilized and harnessed for the benefit of man generally and his health specifically. These Arabic astrologers considered medicine and astrology as complementing one another; the former investigates terrestrial causes and the latter the celestial ones which themselves determine the conditions surrounding human beings. During the Western Renaissance, many of the physicians and occultists were acquainted with the works of such Arabic astrologers and appropriated their theory of astral influences to defend their occult thought and practices. In this article, I discuss the impact of the Arabic theory of astral influences on the medicine of Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) and Jean Fernel (1497–1558).",

    "year": "2013",
    "authors": "Marlow",
    "item_type": "journalArticle",
    "place": "",
    "publisher": "Brill",
    "abstract": "The mirror for princes known as the Naṣīḥat al-mulūk of al-Māwardī, probably a tenth-century text, is replete with references to sources identified by the author as \"Indian\". A large number of these texts also appear in the so-called Waṣiyyat Ariṣṭāṭālīs li-l-Iskandar, some examples find parallels in Kalīla wa-Dimna and Bilawhar wa-Būḏāsaf. These coincidences raise several possibilities: first, that the author’s \"Indian\" source represents a work of Indie background, translated from Sanskrit or another Indian language into Arabic, probably at the time when the Barmakids were sponsoring such translations in significant numbers; secondly, that it was rendered from an Indian language into Middle Persian in the Sasanian period and from that language into Arabic in the early centuries of the Islamic era; thirdly, that the text was composed in a non-Indian language, probably Middle Persian, and acquired a \"forged\" Indian genealogy in a parallel to the numerous spurious Greek attributions (a category that would subsequently include the pseudo-Aristotelian testament). The article addresses these three possibilities, and, on the basis of textual and contextual considerations, suggests that at the present stage of research, it is the second that seems most likely. Le miroir des princes connu sous le titre de Naṣīḥat al-mulūk et attribue à al-Māwardī, sans doute un texte du dixième siècle, comprend maintes references a des sources identifiées par l’auteur comme «indiennes». Un grand nombre de ces textes apparaît également dans la Waṣiyyat Arisṭāṭālīs li-l-Iskandar, quelques exemples ne sont pas sans rappeler Kalīla wa-Dimna et Bilawhar wa-Būḏāsaf. Ces coincidences ouvrent la porte à plusieurs possibilités: primo, que la source «indienne» de l’auteur représente un ouvrage d’origine indo-européenne traduit à partir du sanskrit ou d'une autre langue indienne vers l'arabe, probablement à l’epoque où les Barmécides encourageaient ces traductions à grande échelle; secundo, qu'elle fut transmise d’une langue indienne en moyen perse (pahlévi) à la période sassanide, puis en arabe dans les premiers siècles de l'Islam; tertio, que le texte fut composé en moyen perse et acquit une généalogie indienne «forgée» a l’instar de tant d’attributions prétendument grecques, comme cela s'avéra ultérieurement le cas pour le Testament du pseudo-Aristote. Cet article examine les trois hypothèses et — sur la base de considērations textuelles comme contextuelles — suggère que, dans l’état actuel de la recherche, c’est la deuxième qui semble la plus vraisemblable.",

    "abstract": "The De Mundo (hereafter DM) occupies somewhat of a unique position in the \nhistory of philosophical and scientific transmission from Greek to Syriac and \nArabic in that the complete work is extant in all three languages. What is more, \nthere are in fact three separate versions in Arabic,1 not to mention two Armenian \ntranslations,2 as well as an early Latin version, the work of Apuleius (c.125c.180).3 Too often we have only testimonia that this or that text was translated into1  This version has only been well known since the publications of S.M. Stern, ‘The \nArabic Translations of the Pseudo-Aristotelian Treatise De Mundo’, Le Muséon, 77 (1964): \npp. 187-204, and ‘A Third Arabic Translation of the Pseudo-Aristotelian Treatise De \nMundo’, Le Muséon, 78 (1965): pp. 381-93; see also F. Klein-Franke, ‘Die Überlieferung \nder ältesten arabischen Handschrift von Pseudo-Aristoteles De Mundo’, Le Muséon, 87 \n(1974): pp. 59-65, for an important clarification of the relationship to the Greek and Syriac \ntexts. D.A. Brafman, The Arabic De Mundo: An Edition with Translation and Commentary \n(Ph.D. dissertation, Duke University, 1985), made the texts more widely available, but \nsince he did not know Syriac, from which at least two of the three translations were made, \nhe made some mistakes in interpretation. Incidentally, the Princeton Arabic MS of the DM \nalso contains the related Treatise on the Movement of the Universe (Risālah fī ḥarakat alkull) by Alexander of Aphrodisias (fols 176r-177r); for an edition and English translation, \nsee C. Genequand, Alexander of Aphrodisias on the Cosmos (Leiden, 2000), pp. 136-43; \nthe Syriac version of this treatise had, like the DM, been translated from Greek by Sergius \nof Reshaina (on whom see below). I am currently preparing an edition (with English \ntranslation and commentary) of the Syriac and Arabic versions of the DM.",

    "abstract": "Spanning the Islamic world, from ninth-century Baghdad to nineteenth-century Iran, this book tells the story of the key Muslim map-makers and the art of Islamic cartography. Muslims were uniquely placed to explore the edges of the inhabited world and their maps stretched from Isfahan to Palermo, from Istanbul to Cairo and Aden. Over a similar period, Muslim artists developed distinctive styles, often based on geometrical patterns and calligraphy. Map-makers, including al-Khwarazmi and al-Idrisi, combined novel cartographical techniques with art, science and geographical knowledge. The results could be aesthetically stunning and mathematically sophisticated, politically charged as well as a celebration of human diversity. 0'Islamic Maps' examines Islamic visual interpretations of the world in their historical context, through the lives of the map-makers themselves. What was the purpose of their maps, what choices did they make and what was the argument they were trying to convey? Lavishly illustrated with stunning manuscripts, beautiful instruments and Qibla charts, this book shows how maps constructed by Muslim map-makers capture the many dimensions of Islamic civilisation, providing a window into the worldviews of Islamic societies",

    "abstract": "La carte du monde de 1460 de l'école de Fra Mauro, aujourd'hui l'un des joyaux du Museo Correr et de la Biblioteca Marciana de Venise, est à juste titre considérée comme l'exemple le plus important de la cartographie occidentale à la veille des découvertes d'outre-mer. Quelle idée de la terre est à son origine? De quelle façon la carte de Fra Mauro est-elle liée à la conception du globe moderne? La présentation explique le modèle sphérique de la Terre à l'origine de la,carte de Fra Mauro' et sa conception d'ensemble. Il est représenté grâce à des annotations individuelles et de la « Thèse sur l'émergence de la Terre de la sphère aquatique » reproduite sur la carte. La philosophie naturelle aristotélicienne, la géographie ptolémique et les mesures du monde connu se complètent pour constituer l'image d'un demi-globe, un hémisphère émergeant de la sphère aquatique et dont la surface visible reste ouverte à la population humaine et à l'expérience et à la description des voyageurs, des marins et des géographes. Avec une section en bois massif en forme d›anneau qui entoure la célèbre œcuménicité et l›océan côtier, la,carte Fra Mauro' montre les frontières reconnues à l'époque d'une possible expérience géographique. Ce n'est qu'avec la traversée de l›océan de Christophe Colomb et le récit d'Amerigo Vespucci sur la découverte des antipodes d›outre-mer, que cette limite de l›expérience, encore indiscutable pour Fra Mauro et ses contemporains en 1460, a été dépassée. Le processus des découvertes d›outre-mer et leur réception dans le début du 16ème siècle ont élargi la géographie du monde antique à l›image du globe moderne. Un monde auquel s'oppose la,carte Fra Mauro'; le dernier témoignage important d'une géographie limitée à un hémisphère de la fin du Moyen Âge et du monde antique.",

When to this mingling of Greco-Indian and Greco-Iranian astronomy was added the more Ptolemaic Greco-Syrian in the late eighth and early ninth centuries, and the completely Ptolemaic Byzantine tradition during the course of the ninth, the attention of Islamic astronomers was turned to those areas where these several astronomical systems were in conflict. This led to the development in Islam of a mathematical astronomy that was essentially Ptolemaic, but in which new parameters were introduced and new solutions to problems in spherical trigonometry derived from India tended to replace those of the Almagest.",

The manuscript, compiled in the late eleventh century and copied in the early thirteenth century, contains several maps of considerable importance to the history of cartography. Of particular interest is a unique rectangular world map, incorporating a graphic scale, which may reflect a map known to have been made for the caliph al-Maʾmūn (reg. 813-833), but now lost, or a projection proposed by Marinus of Tyre and discussed by Ptolemy. A second world map, circular in form, is of the type usually misattributed to al-Idrīsī (fl.1154). The maps of the Mediterranean Sea and of Sicily, Cyprus, Tinnīs, and al-Mahdīya appear to be original to our treatise. The manuscript is the subject of a forthcoming major research programme, based at the Bodleian Library and The Oriental Institute, University of Oxford, and the present essay presents only our preliminary findings.",

    "abstract": "This part of Chapter 2 offers two definitions of ‘cosmos’ and then describes the latter as a whole containing the largest stable structures composed of the five elements: aether, fire, air, water and earth. It explains the division of the cosmos into the upper or supralunary part, which is made of aether and where things are incorruptible and in regular circular motion, and the lower or sublunary part, where things are diverse and less regular, composed of the remaining four elements, and subject to constant generation and corruption. The perfect supralunary part forms a system of concentric rotating spheres. While the fixed stars all move ‘on one visible surface of the whole of the heavens’, where they keep their position, the planets are simply said to each move in their own orbit, with no explicit mention of the higher number of moving spheres posited by Eudoxus or Callippus. Below the lowest planetary sphere, that of the Moon, the sublunary part of the cosmos begins. It is also organised in concentric spheres, each one dominated by one of the four elements, starting with fire and ending with earth in the immobile centre of the universe. The author pays special attention to the immutable aether that belongs to the causal chain extending from God to all the motions in the earthly region of the universe. In virtue of its physical perfection, the ether is indispensable for God’s guidance and administration of all heaven and Earth.",

The author provides an outline of cosmology, geography and meteorology, only to argue that a full understanding of the cosmos cannot be achieved without a proper grasp of God as its ultimate cause. To ensure such a grasp, the author provides a series of twelve carefully chosen interlocking analogies, building a complex picture in the reader's mind. The work develops a distinctly Aristotelian picture of God and the cosmos while paying tribute to pre-Aristotelian philosophers and avoiding open criticism of rival schools of philosophy. De mundo exercised considerable influence in late antiquity and then in the Renaissance and Early Modern times.",

In this contribution, we look at the details of the author’s account and analyse it in the context of the historical development of ancient geographic ideas. There is a number of indications that the text can be dated to later Hellenistic times: the author’s view on the insularity of the inhabited world, on the nature and role of the ocean and its connection with the Caspian/Hyrcanian Sea, on the borders between the continents and on the calculation of the dimensions of the inhabited world (oikoumenē). We argue that the author might have been influenced by the treatises on the ocean as a literary model for this section of De mundo. We know that authors such as Pytheas of Massalia, Posidonius of Apamea and Athenodorus of Tharsus wrote works under the title On the Ocean, which survive only in scarce fragments. The information we can extract from De mundo in this respect is, therefore, invaluable for a reconstruction of the content, circulation and reception of this sub-genre of geographic literature in the last decades of Hellenism.",

    "abstract": "This paper talks about the earliest Islamic knowledge on the Far East based on 8th – 12th century extant works on geography as well as travel accounts. It shows how pre-Islamic works on geography, e.g. the al-Ğuġrafyā of Ptolemy, the Sindhind of the Indians, and imperial practices of the pre-Islamic Persia, influenced the thinkers of medieval Islam. It offers a comprehensive overview on the development of Islamic geographical practicesin the Middle Ages by consulting the works of Ibn Khurdādhbih (d. 912 CE), al-Marwazī (d. 887 CE), al-Ya‘qūbī (d. 897 CE), al-Nadīm (fl. 10th century), al-Khwārizmī (d. 850 CE), Al-Mas‘ūdī (d. 956 CE), al-Sīrāfī (fl. 10th century), ibn Ḥauqal (d. 977 CE), al-Muqaddasī (d. 991 CE), al-Andalusī (d. 1070 CE), among others. The paper highlights the parts that cover the Far East in Nuzhat al-Mushtāq fi ikhtirāq al-āfāq, also known as the Book of Roger, a magnum opus written by a 12th century Sicilian scholar, al-Sharīf al-Idrīsī. The sections of Nuzhat al-Mushtāq that talk about the Far East are translated from its original language to English. An excerpt from the translation is included in this paper. The progression of Nuzhat al-Mushtāq, which started upon the invitation of King Roger II of al-Sharīf al-Idrīsī to his court in Palermo and the commissioning of the latter to make a map of the world, as well as the biography of al-Sharīf al-Idrīsī are also presented in this endeavor.",

    "abstract": "Among the geographical studies on the better understanding and recognition of the earth, the evaluations based on a mathematical position are very crucial. Today, this mathematical positioning based on latitude and longitude has been conceptualized as latitude and longitude by Islamic geographers. The basis for this is the division of the earth into seven or eight geographic regions. Islamic geographers accepted the northern half of the world as settled. They divided this part from the equator into seven, and called each section a ‘climate’. These climates were named true climates. This division, by some researchers, was based on Batlamyus (Ptolemy), and hence the Greeks, and by some researchers on Iranian geographers. However, it was the Islamic geographers who developed and spread this. Ibn Hurdazbih, Mesûdî, İbn Havkal, Makdisî were some of these geographers. At this point, the famous Islamic geographer who offered innovations as methods was Ebü’l-Fidâ. Ebü’l-Fidâ, who evaluated every city based on the real climate in his work titled “Takvîmü’l-büldân”, also affected the geographers after him. Ottoman geographers also wrote their own works based on this method. Ottoman geographers; Mustafa b. Ali el Muvakkit (Tuhfetü’z-zamân ve harîdetü’l-evân) Âşık Mehmed (Menâzırü’l-avâlim), Mehmed Suûdî (Târîh-i Hind-i Garbî), Sipâhîzâde Mehmed (Evzahu’l-mesâlik), Kâtib Çelebi (Cihânnüma), and Evliya Çelebi (Seyahatnâme) differentiated and defined the earth and cities from the true climate perspective. Within the scope of this study, the essence of true climates, the sources on which they are based, the definitions of Islamic and Ottoman geographers about the true climate and the methods of using true climates; will be discussed through examples and figures. At the end of the study, it is aimed to present a perspective on the naming and classification of current geographic locations in the past.",

A substantial and formative part of Müʾeyyedzade’s education took place during his extended sojourn in Shiraz during the late 1470s and early 1480s, in the vicinity of such luminaries as Jalāl al-Dīn Dawānī, Ṣadr al-Dīn and Ghiyāth al-Dīn Dashtakī, Mīr Ḥusayn Maybudī and possibly the young Shams al-Dīn Khafrī. The surviving early sixteenth century inventory of Müʾeyyedzade’s library sheds light on the texts that were available to Ottoman intellectual circles outside of and indeed beyond the Ottoman madrasa and palace libraries at the turn of the sixteenth century. Both the inventory and external evidence show Müʾeyyedzade’s connections to scholars around and across the Mediterranean and confirm the extent of his interest in these sciences. This article argues that his activities as a scholar, patron and collector of books and as a convenor of intellectual salons were part of a larger shared intellectual geography of the Aegean, Adriatic, and wider Mediterranean Seas that constituted the fertile grounds of late Renaissance scholarship – East and West.",

    "abstract": "This paper talks about the earliest Islamic knowledge on the Far East based on 8th – 12th century extant works on geography as well as travel accounts. It shows how pre-Islamic works on geography, e.g. the al-Ğuġrafyā of Ptolemy, the Sindhind of the Indians, and imperial practices of the pre-Islamic Persia, influenced the thinkers of medieval Islam. It offers a comprehensive overview on the development of Islamic geographical practicesin the Middle Ages by consulting the works of Ibn Khurdādhbih (d. 912 CE), al-Marwazī (d. 887 CE), al-Ya‘qūbī (d. 897 CE), al-Nadīm (fl. 10th century), al-Khwārizmī (d. 850 CE), Al-Mas‘ūdī (d. 956 CE), al-Sīrāfī (fl. 10th century), ibn Ḥauqal (d. 977 CE), al-Muqaddasī (d. 991 CE), al-Andalusī (d. 1070 CE), among others. The paper highlights the parts that cover the Far East in Nuzhat al-Mushtāq fi ikhtirāq al-āfāq, also known as the Book of Roger, a magnum opus written by a 12th century Sicilian scholar, al-Sharīf al-Idrīsī. The sections of Nuzhat al-Mushtāq that talk about the Far East are translated from its original language to English. An excerpt from the translation is included in this paper. The progression of Nuzhat al-Mushtāq, which started upon the invitation of King Roger II of al-Sharīf al-Idrīsī to his court in Palermo and the commissioning of the latter to make a map of the world, as well as the biography of al-Sharīf al-Idrīsī are also presented in this endeavor.",

    "abstract": "The existence of an Arabic translation of Ptolemy’s Almagest by the polymath and translator Thābit ibn Qurra (d. 901) was long denied and widely not considered as a possibility by historians of Islamic science. In 2012, I was able to correct the established view, proving that Thābit ibn Qurra produced his own version of the Almagest, and show that a Latin fragment in Dresden was translated from Thābit’s unknown Arabic text. The fragment also revealed that Thābit ibn Qurra made systematic changes to the content and the format of Ptolemy’s arguments. Since my discovery of this unknown Arabic tradition of Ptolemy, it has been possible to associate with it the works of prominent Islamic astronomers – among them Avicenna and al-Ṭūsī – due to their adoption of Thābit’s changes to Ptolemy’s original work. However, whereas the primary transmission of Thābit’s translation seemed lost, Arabic-speaking authors who used Thābit’s work not only differ but also contradict each other in what they suggest to be original elements of the text. This paper discusses selected features of Thābit ibn Qurra’s translation of the Almagest and their inconsistent transmission in the sources in view of the Arabic text in MS Jaipur, Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, 20. It is based on my attribution of the Jaipur text to the Thābit tradition in 2015 as well as a recent thorough inspection of the manuscript in Jaipur.",

    "abstract": "Batlamyusçu evren modelinde yerküre âlemin merkezinde konumlandırılır. Bu modelde yerin merkezi aynı zamanda âlemin de merkezidir. Aristoteles fiziğine göre kurgulanan bu sistem, 16. yüzyılda güneş merkezli evren modeli benimseninceye değin hakim teori olarak kabul görmüştür. Yer merkezli bu teoride yerkürenin aynı zamanda tamamen hareketsiz olduğu kabul edilir. Onun için kendi ekseni etrafında ya da başka bir gök cisminin etrafında hareket söz konusu değildir. Teleskop gibi ileri düzey rasat aletlerinin henüz kullanılmadığı antik dönemde ve orta çağda bu teorinin doğrudan duyu ile elde edilen verilerle rasyonel olarak temellendirildiği görülür. Bu çerçevede dünyanın merkezde oluşu ve hareketsizliğine dair çeşitli gerekçeler sunulmuştur. Meşşâî felsefenin Müslüman dünyadaki temsilcilerinin de yer merkezli sistemi kabul ettikleri görülür. Kitâbu’şŞifâ, es-Semâu ve’l-â’lem’de İbn Sînâ (ö. 1038) müstakil bir fasıl ayırarak yerin hareketsizliğine dair kendisine kadar gelen delilleri bir kritiğe tabi tutmuştur. İbn Sînâcı felsefenin 14. yüzyıldaki takipçisi Necmeddin el-Kâtibî de Hikmetü’l-‘ayn’da bu konuyu ele almış, eserin şârihleri ise onun değerlendirmelerini yorumlamışlardır. Bu çalışmada yer merkezli evren modelinde yerin hareketsizliğine dair İbn Sînâ’nın değerlendirmeleri ele alınacak ve bu değerlendirmelerin İbn Sînâcı bir metin olan Hikmetü’l-‘ayn’daki yansımaları irdelenecektir.",

    "abstract": "The discipline of the history of geography, both in Turkey and worldwide, usually tends to attribute modern geographic knowledge to geographical studies in ancient Greece via the Renaissance. Developments in mathematical geography, cartography and astronomy especially in non-Western societies during the interim period have not received the attention they deserve. Fuat Sezgin devoted almost all his scholarly life to fill this gap. Yâqût al-Hamavî and hundreds of other scholars from around the Crescent are indebted to him for his crucial understanding of the void between the level of geography in ancient Greece and the level of progress in the science of geography which suddenly emerged in 16th Century Europe. In this context, despite its deficiencies, Yâqût al-Hamavî’s Muʿcam al-buldân is a notable example of that sophistication in geographical knowledge in the non-Western world. Written in the last quarter of the 13th Century, the 4,000-page glossary of geographical terms is worth emphasis both for the citations from its predecessors which have not reached the present day and for the rigour in dealing with the subjects. Since geography is indicative of science being a process of production of universal knowledge, regarding geographers independent of their respective cultural domains in recording the history of geography will also mean honouring the legacy of Fuat Sezgin.",

A facsimile edition of the unique MS, which came to light in Bukhara in the late 19th century, was published in Russia in 1930 by Barthold but it was left to Minorsky to make the data widely accessible by his English translation and his extensive commentary, which analyses the work&#39;s position in the early Islamic geographical tradition and identifies and discusses the places mentioned in the light of a wealth of other information. V. Minorsky was a former Professor of Persian in the University of London and his other translations include Tadhkirat al-Muluk, A Manual of Safavid Administration in this series.",
