      "text": "Map Orientation\n1\t\r\nThe orientation of a map is the relationship between the\r\ndirections on the map and the corresponding compass directions\r\nin reality. The word “orient” is derived from Latin oriens,\r\nmeaning “East”. In the Middle Ages many maps, including the\r\nubiquitous T-O maps, were drawn with East at the top (meaning\r\nthat the direction “up” on the map corresponds to East on the\r\ncompass). Today, the most common – but far from universal –\r\ncartographic convention is that North is at the top of a map.\r\nSeveral kinds of maps are often traditionally not oriented with\r\nNorth at the top:\r\n Maps from non-Western traditions are oriented a variety\r\nof ways. Old maps of Edo show the Japanese imperial palace as\r\nthe “top”, but also at the center, of the map. Labels on the map\r\nare oriented in such a way that you cannot read them properly\r\nunless you put the imperial palace above your head.\r\n Medieval European T-O maps such as the Hereford\r\nmappamundi were centered on Jerusalem with East at the top.\r\nIndeed, prior to the reintroduction of Ptolemy’s Geography to\r\nEurope around 1400, there was no single convention in the West.\r\nportolan charts, for example, are oriented to the shores they\r\ndescribe.\r\n Maps of cities bordering a sea are often conventionally\r\noriented with the sea at the top.\r\n Route and channel maps have traditionally been oriented to the road or\r\nwaterway they describe.\r\n Polar maps of the Arctic or Antarctic regions are conventionally centered on the\r\npole; the direction North would be towards or away from the centre of the map,\r\nrespectively. Typical maps of the Arctic have 0° meridian towards the bottom of the\r\npage; maps of the Antarctic have the 0° meridian towards the top of the page.\r\n Reversed maps, also known as Upside-Down maps or South-Up maps, reverse the\r\n“North is up” convention and have South at the top. An orientation very common with\r\nArab Islamic maps.\r\n Maps are usually created from a particular direction. The directionality of a map\r\nis known as its orientation. The popularity of online mapping such as Google Maps has\r\nconditioned many people to expect due north to always be towards the top of the map\r\nand south towards the bottom. As mentioned, historically, maps have not always been\r\noriented north. Different geographic and religious influences have changed over time\r\nhow maps are oriented. Aesthetics, political interests, egotism, and navigation are some\r\nof the other reasons why cartographers over the ages have used different map\r\norientations.",

Bibliotheque\r\nnational de France.\r\n Catalan Atlas, 1375 #235\r\nUnlike many other nautical charts, the Catalan Atlas is meant to be read (according to the\r\nArabic tradition) with the north at the bottom; thus the maps are oriented—from left to\r\nright—from the Far East to the Atlantic. The assemblage of plates giving an overall view\r\nof the document is presented as it is meant to be read, in other words with the south\r\nuppermost; but to facilitate consultation, excerpts from the Atlas are shown with the\r\nnorth uppermost.\r\n Often the question of the “correct” orientation of the sheets arose. George\r\nGrosjean, in his commentary on the 1977 facsimile edition of the Atlas, stresses that the\r\norientation of this map must be understood from its essential part. The map was\r\nconstructed in the portolano style, a type of medieval navigation chart which was\r\nintended to lie on the chart-table of a ship and always was oriented to the necessities of\r\nnavigation, thus there is no “orientation of priority” of such maps. Since the Atlas was\r\nnot intended as a portolano for daily use but instead was a luxury edition for a princely\r\n(or royal) library, it is useless to ask for correct orientation of the map-sheets. This fact\r\nnotwithstanding, however, as the legends that are legible prevail in north-orientation, in\r\nthe modern literature of the maps the north-orientation is now adopted.",

Launched by Australian Stuart\r\nMcArthur on Jan. 26, 1979 (Australia Day, naturally), this map is supposed to challenge\r\nour casual acceptance of European perspectives as global norms.\r\nThe McArthur map also makes us wonder why we are so quick to assume that\r\nNorthern Europeans were the ones who invented the modern map — and decided\r\nwhich way to hold it — in the first place. As is so often the case, our eagerness to invoke\r\nEurocentrism displays a certain bias of its own, since in fact, the north’s elite\r\ncartographic status owes more to Byzantine monks and Majorcan Jews than it does to\r\nany Englishman.\r\nThere is nothing inevitable or intrinsically correct — not in geographic,\r\ncartographic or even philosophical terms — about the north being represented as “up”,\r\nbecause “up” on a map is a human construction, not a natural one. Some of the very\r\nearliest Egyptian maps show the south as up, presumably equating the Nile’s northward\r\nflow with the force of gravity. And there was a long stretch in the medieval era when\r\nmost European maps were drawn with the east on the top. If there was any doubt about\r\nthis move’s religious significance, they illuminated it with their maps’ pious\r\nillustrations, whether of Adam and Eve or Christ enthroned. In the same period, Arab\r\nmap makers often drew maps with the south facing up, possibly because this was how\r\nthe Chinese did it.",

For\r\nexample, maps created by the City of\r\nSanta Monica have a rotation of 46\r\ndegrees so that the beach is always\r\nshown at the bottom of maps. This is\r\ndone for aesthetic purposes and results in\r\nan orientation that is northeast instead of\r\ndue north.\r\n The New York City Department\r\nof Transportation places pedestrian\r\nfriendly maps around the city with the\r\norientation rotated to be “heads-up” or\r\nforward-facing so that viewers are facing\r\nthe map in the same direction they\r\nstanding for readability. This helps\r\npedestrians to better orient themselves in\r\nrelationship to the landmarks on the map\r\nand to better navigate the city.\r\n Polar Maps of the Arctic and\r\nAntarctica have custom projections with\r\norientations towards the poles.\r\n There is nothing inevitable or\r\nintrinsically correct — not in geographic,\r\ncartographic or even philosophical terms\r\n— about the North being represented as\r\nup, because “up” on a map is a human\r\nconstruction, not a natural one.\r\n Beginning in the Mediterranean,\r\nsomewhere between Europe and the\r\nArab world in the 14th and 15th centuries,\r\nincreasingly precise navigational maps of",
