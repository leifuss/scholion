  "1": "Map Orientation\r\n\t\r\n\t 1\t\r\nThe orientation of a map is the relationship between the\r\ndirections on the map and the corresponding compass directions\r\nin reality. The word “orient” is derived from Latin oriens,\r\nmeaning “East”. In the Middle Ages many maps, including the\r\nubiquitous T-O maps, were drawn with East at the top (meaning\r\nthat the direction “up” on the map corresponds to East on the\r\ncompass). Today, the most common – but far from universal –\r\ncartographic convention is that North is at the top of a map.\r\nSeveral kinds of maps are often traditionally not oriented with\r\nNorth at the top:\r\n Maps from non-Western traditions are oriented a variety\r\nof ways. Old maps of Edo show the Japanese imperial palace as\r\nthe “top”, but also at the center, of the map. Labels on the map\r\nare oriented in such a way that you cannot read them properly\r\nunless you put the imperial palace above your head.\r\n Medieval European T-O maps such as the Hereford\r\nmappamundi were centered on Jerusalem with East at the top.\r\nIndeed, prior to the reintroduction of Ptolemy’s Geography to\r\nEurope around 1400, there was no single convention in the West.\r\nportolan charts, for example, are oriented to the shores they\r\ndescribe.\r\n Maps of cities bordering a sea are often conventionally\r\noriented with the sea at the top.\r\n Route and channel maps have traditionally been oriented to the road or\r\nwaterway they describe.\r\n Polar maps of the Arctic or Antarctic regions are conventionally centered on the\r\npole; the direction North would be towards or away from the centre of the map,\r\nrespectively. Typical maps of the Arctic have 0° meridian towards the bottom of the\r\npage; maps of the Antarctic have the 0° meridian towards the top of the page.\r\n Reversed maps, also known as Upside-Down maps or South-Up maps, reverse the\r\n“North is up” convention and have South at the top. An orientation very common with\r\nArab Islamic maps.\r\n Maps are usually created from a particular direction. The directionality of a map\r\nis known as its orientation. The popularity of online mapping such as Google Maps has\r\nconditioned many people to expect due north to always be towards the top of the map\r\nand south towards the bottom. As mentioned, historically, maps have not always been\r\noriented north. Different geographic and religious influences have changed over time\r\nhow maps are oriented. Aesthetics, political interests, egotism, and navigation are some\r\nof the other reasons why cartographers over the ages have used different map\r\norientations.\r\n \r\nNorth Orientation Maps\r\n Claudius Ptolemy (90-168 AD/CE, #119), a classical Greek cartographer was\r\ncredited with creating the first known atlas. His collection of cartography in Geographia,\r\nwas an early example of orienting maps towards the north. North orientation came back\r\ninto favor during the Great Age of Exploration with the need for seafaring explorers to\r\norient themselves with their compasses. The importance of orienting maps towards the\r\nnorth was a reflection of the importance of knowing where magnetic north was. Today,",

European\r\ncartographers oriented their maps towards the Holy Land since Jerusalem was the place\r\nof Christ’s death and resurrection. In fact, the world “orient” comes from the Latin\r\nword “oriens”, meaning “East”. And there was a long stretch in\r\nthe medieval era when most European maps were drawn with\r\nthe East on the top. If there was any doubt about this move’s\r\nreligious significance, they illuminated it with their maps’ pious\r\nillustrations, whether of Adam and Eve or Christ enthroned.\r\nExamples of maps with an east orientation are the mappamundi\r\n(medieval European world maps) such as the T-O map (see\r\n#205). The T-O maps was a symbolic representation of the\r\nworld, with the O representing boundary of the world,\r\nencircled by the earth’s oceans. The T nested inside the O divided the world into the\r\nNorthern Hemispheres’ three continents: Asia at the top, Europe to the left, and Africa\r\nto the right (the southern hemisphere was ignored as it was considered inhabitable at\r\nthe time). The horizontal bar of the T represented the Mediterranean Sea and the vertical\r\nportion of the T the Nile and Tanais [Don] Rivers.
